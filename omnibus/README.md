# Client Tools Omnibus project

This project creates full-stack platform-specific packages for the following projects:

- AngryChef
- Chef
- Chef with FIPS enabled

## Installation

You must have a sane Ruby environment with Bundler installed. Ensure all the required gems are installed:

```shell
$ bundle install --without development
```

## Usage

### Build

You create a platform-specific package using the `build project` command:

```shell
$ bundle exec omnibus build <PROJECT>
```

The platform/architecture type of the package created will match the platform where the `build project` command is invoked. For example, running this command on a MacBook Pro will generate a Mac OS X package. After the build completes packages will be available in the `pkg/` folder.

### Clean

You can clean up all temporary files generated during the build process with the `clean` command:

```shell
$ bundle exec omnibus clean <PROJECT>
```

Adding the `--purge` purge option removes **ALL** files generated during the build including the project install directory (`/opt/chef`) and the package cache directory (`/var/cache/omnibus/pkg`):

```shell
$ bundle exec omnibus clean <PROJECT> --purge
```

### Publish

Omnibus has a built-in mechanism for releasing to a variety of "backends", such as Amazon S3 and Artifactory. You must set the proper credentials in your `omnibus.rb` config file or specify them via the command line.

```shell
$ bundle exec omnibus publish path/to/*.deb --backend s3
```

### Help

Full help for the Omnibus command line interface can be accessed with the `help` command:

```shell
$ bundle exec omnibus help
```

## Kitchen-based Build Environment

Every Omnibus project ships will a project-specific [Berksfile](https://docs.chef.io/berkshelf.html) that will allow you to build your omnibus projects on all of the projects listed in the `kitchen.yml`. You can add/remove additional platforms as needed by changing the list found in the `kitchen.yml` `platforms` YAML stanza.

This build environment is designed to get you up-and-running quickly. However, there is nothing that restricts you to building on other platforms. Simply use the [omnibus cookbook](https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/omnibus) to setup your desired platform and execute the build steps listed above.

The default build environment requires Test Kitchen and VirtualBox for local development. Test Kitchen also exposes the ability to provision instances using various cloud providers like AWS, DigitalOcean, or OpenStack. For more information, please see the [Test Kitchen documentation](http://kitchen.ci).

Once you have tweaked your `kitchen.yml` (or `kitchen.local.yml`) to your liking, you can bring up an individual build environment using the `kitchen` command.

```shell
$ bundle exec kitchen converge chef-ubuntu-1404
```

Additional settings are required if using the kitchen-vagrant driver with the Hyper-V provider:

```
PS> $env:KITCHEN_LOCAL_YAML="kitchen.hyperv.yml"; kitchen converge chef-windows-server-2012r2-standard
```

Then login to the instance and build the project as described in the Usage section:

```shell
$ bundle exec kitchen login <PROJECT>-ubuntu-1204
[vagrant@ubuntu...] $ cd chef/omnibus
[vagrant@ubuntu...] $ bundle install --without development # Don't install dev tools!
[vagrant@ubuntu...] $ ...
[vagrant@ubuntu...] $ bundle exec omnibus build <PROJECT> -l internal
```

```shell
$ kitchen login chef-ubuntu-1404
[vagrant@ubuntu...] $ source load-omnibus-toolchain.sh
[vagrant@ubuntu...] $ cd chef/omnibus
[vagrant@ubuntu...] $ bundle install --without development # Don't install dev tools!
[vagrant@ubuntu...] $ ...
[vagrant@ubuntu...] $ bundle exec omnibus build chef -l internal
```

You can also login to Windows instances but will have to manually call the `load-omnibus-toolchain.ps1` script from an administrative PowerShell session which initializes the build environment. You will also need to `git clone https://github.com/chef/chef` into the `c:\vagrant` folder to workaround the lack of a shared folder.

```shell
$ bundle exec kitchen login <PROJECT>-windows-81-professional

```
