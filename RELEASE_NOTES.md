# Chef Client Release Notes:

#### CHEF-5223 OS X Service provider regression.

This commit: https://github.com/opscode/chef/commit/024b1e3e4de523d3c1ebbb42883a2bef3f9f415c
introduced a requirement that a service have a plist file for any
action, but a service that is being created will not have a plist file
yet. Chef now only requires that a service have a plist for the enable
and disable actions.

#### Signal Regression Fix

CHEF-1761 introduced a regression for signal handling when not in daemon mode
(see CHEF-5172). Chef will now, once again, exit immediately on SIGTERM if it
is not in daemon mode, otherwise it will complete it's current run before
existing.

#### Knife local data bag support

People already use a VCS as the source-of-truth for roles and cookbooks,
but with encrypted databags it's not possible to do this. This enables
creating, editing, and showing of databags (encrypted or otherwise) using
local files.
