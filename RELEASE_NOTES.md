# Chef Client Release Notes:

#### Chef Solo Missing Dependency Warning ([CHEF-4367](https://tickets.opscode.com/browse/CHEF-4367))

Chef 11.0 introduced ordered evaluation of non-recipe files in
cookbooks, based on the dependencies specified in your cookbooks'
metadata. This was a huge improvement on the previous behavior for all
chef users, but it also introduced a problem for chef-solo users:
because of the way chef-solo works, it was possible to use
`include_recipe` to load a recipe from a cookbook without specifying the
dependency in the metadata. This would load the recipe without having
evaluated the associated attributes, libraries, LWRPs, etc. in that
recipe's cookbook, and the recipe would fail to load with errors that
did not suggest the actual cause of the failure.

We've added a check to `include_recipe` so that attempting to include a
recipe which is not a dependency of any cookbook specified in the run
list will now log a warning with a message describing the problem and
solution. In the future, this warning will become an error.

#### reboot_pending?  

We have added a ```reboot_pending?``` method to the recipe DSL. This method returns true or false if the operating system
has a rebooting pending due to updates and a reboot being necessary to complete the installation. It does not report if a reboot has been requested, e.g. if someone has scheduled a restart using shutdown. It currently supports Windows and Ubuntu Linux.

```
Chef::Log.warn "There is a pending reboot, which will affect this Chef run" if reboot_pending?

execute "Install Application" do
  command 'C:\application\setup.exe'
  not_if { reboot_pending? }
end
```

#### FileEdit

Chef::Util::Filedit has been refactored into a Chef::Util::Editor class. The existing class continues to manage the files being edited while the new class handles the actual modification of the data.
Along with this refactor, #insert_line_if_no_match can now manipulate a file multiple times.

#### Miscellaneous

* The subversion resource will now mask plaintext passwords in error output.
* The debian pkg provider now supports epochs in the version string.
* When a cookbook upload is missing multiple dependencies, all of them are now listed.

#### OHAI 7

After spending 3 months in the RC stage, OHAI 7 is now included in Chef Client 11.10.0. Note that Chef Client 10.32.0 still includes OHAI 6.
