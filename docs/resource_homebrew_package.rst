.. tag resource_package_homebrew

Use the **homebrew_package** resource to manage packages for the macOS platform.

.. end_tag

New in Chef Client 12.0.

.. note:: .. tag notes_resource_based_on_package

          In many cases, it is better to use the **package** resource instead of this one. This is because when the **package** resource is used in a recipe, the chef-client will use details that are collected by Ohai at the start of the chef-client run to determine the correct package application. Using the **package** resource allows a recipe to be authored in a way that allows it to be used across many platforms.

          .. end_tag

Syntax
=====================================================
.. tag resource_package_homebrew_syntax

A **homebrew_package** resource block manages a package on a node, typically by installing it. The simplest use of the **homebrew_package** resource is:

.. code-block:: ruby

   homebrew_package 'package_name'

which will install the named package using all of the default options and the default action (``:install``).

The full syntax for all of the properties that are available to the **homebrew_package** resource is:

.. code-block:: ruby

   homebrew_package 'name' do
     homebrew_user              String, Integer
     notifies                   # see description
     options                    String
     package_name               String, Array # defaults to 'name' if not specified
     provider                   Chef::Provider::Package::Homebrew
     source                     String
     subscribes                 # see description
     timeout                    String, Integer
     version                    String, Array
     action                     Symbol # defaults to :install if not specified
   end

where

* ``homebrew_package`` tells the chef-client to manage a package
* ``'name'`` is the name of the package
* ``action`` identifies which steps the chef-client will take to bring the node into the desired state
* ``homebrew_user``, ``options``, ``package_name``, ``provider``, ``source``, ``timeout``, and ``version`` are properties of this resource, with the Ruby type shown. See "Properties" section below for more information about all of the properties that may be used with this resource.

.. end_tag

Actions
=====================================================
.. tag resource_package_homebrew_actions

This resource has the following actions:

``:install``
   Default. Install a package. If a version is specified, install the specified version of the package.

``:nothing``
   .. tag resources_common_actions_nothing

   Define this resource block to do nothing until notified by another resource to take action. When this resource is notified, this resource block is either run immediately or it is queued up to be run at the end of the chef-client run.

   .. end_tag

``:purge``
   Purge a package. This action typically removes the configuration files as well as the package.

``:remove``
   Remove a package.

``:upgrade``
   Install a package and/or ensure that a package is the latest version.

.. end_tag

Properties
=====================================================
This resource has the following properties:

``homebrew_user``
   **Ruby Types:** String, Integer

   The name of the Homebrew owner to be used by the chef-client when executing a command.

   .. tag resource_package_homebrew_user

   The chef-client, by default, will attempt to execute a Homebrew command as the owner of ``/usr/local/bin/brew``. If that executable does not exist, the chef-client will attempt to find the user by executing ``which brew``. If that executable cannot be found, the chef-client will print an error message: ``Could not find the "brew" executable in /usr/local/bin or anywhere on the path.``. Use the ``homebrew_user`` attribute to specify the Homebrew owner for situations where the chef-client cannot automatically detect the correct owner.

   .. end_tag

``ignore_failure``
   **Ruby Types:** TrueClass, FalseClass

   Continue running a recipe if a resource fails for any reason. Default value: ``false``.

``notifies``
   **Ruby Type:** Symbol, 'Chef::Resource[String]'

   .. tag resources_common_notification_notifies

   A resource may notify another resource to take action when its state changes. Specify a ``'resource[name]'``, the ``:action`` that resource should take, and then the ``:timer`` for that action. A resource may notifiy more than one resource; use a ``notifies`` statement for each resource to be notified.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag resources_common_notification_timers

   A timer specifies the point during the chef-client run at which a notification is run. The following timers are available:

   ``:before``
      Specifies that the action on a notified resource should be run before processing the resource block in which the notification is located.

   ``:delayed``
      Default. Specifies that a notification should be queued up, and then executed at the very end of the chef-client run.

   ``:immediate``, ``:immediately``
      Specifies that a notification should be run immediately, per resource notified.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag resources_common_notification_notifies_syntax

   The syntax for ``notifies`` is:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      notifies :action, 'resource[name]', :timer

   .. end_tag

``options``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   One (or more) additional options that are passed to the command.

``package_name``
   **Ruby Types:** String, Array

   The name of the package. Default value: the ``name`` of the resource block See "Syntax" section above for more information.

``provider``
   **Ruby Type:** Chef Class

   Optional. Explicitly specifies a provider. See "Providers" section below for more information.

``retries``
   **Ruby Type:** Integer

   The number of times to catch exceptions and retry the resource. Default value: ``0``.

``retry_delay``
   **Ruby Type:** Integer

   The retry delay (in seconds). Default value: ``2``.

``source``
   **Ruby Type:** String

   Optional. The path to a package in the local file system.

``subscribes``
   **Ruby Type:** Symbol, 'Chef::Resource[String]'

   .. tag resources_common_notification_subscribes

   A resource may listen to another resource, and then take action if the state of the resource being listened to changes. Specify a ``'resource[name]'``, the ``:action`` to be taken, and then the ``:timer`` for that action.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag resources_common_notification_timers

   A timer specifies the point during the chef-client run at which a notification is run. The following timers are available:

   ``:before``
      Specifies that the action on a notified resource should be run before processing the resource block in which the notification is located.

   ``:delayed``
      Default. Specifies that a notification should be queued up, and then executed at the very end of the chef-client run.

   ``:immediate``, ``:immediately``
      Specifies that a notification should be run immediately, per resource notified.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag resources_common_notification_subscribes_syntax

   The syntax for ``subscribes`` is:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      subscribes :action, 'resource[name]', :timer

   .. end_tag

``timeout``
   **Ruby Types:** String, Integer

   The amount of time (in seconds) to wait before timing out.

``version``
   **Ruby Types:** String, Array

   The version of a package to be installed or upgraded.

Providers
=====================================================
.. tag resources_common_provider

Where a resource represents a piece of the system (and its desired state), a provider defines the steps that are needed to bring that piece of the system from its current state into the desired state.

.. end_tag

.. tag resources_common_provider_attributes

The chef-client will determine the correct provider based on configuration data collected by Ohai at the start of the chef-client run. This configuration data is then mapped to a platform and an associated list of providers.

Generally, it's best to let the chef-client choose the provider, and this is (by far) the most common approach. However, in some cases, specifying a provider may be desirable. There are two approaches:

* Use a more specific short name---``yum_package "foo" do`` instead of ``package "foo" do``, ``script "foo" do`` instead of ``bash "foo" do``, and so on---when available
* Use the ``provider`` property within the resource block to specify the long name of the provider as a property of a resource. For example: ``provider Chef::Provider::Long::Name``

.. end_tag

.. tag resource_package_homebrew_providers

This resource has the following providers:

``Chef::Provider::Package``, ``package``
   When this short name is used, the chef-client will attempt to determine the correct provider during the chef-client run.

``Chef::Provider::Package::Homebrew``, ``homebrew_package``
   The provider for the macOS platform.

.. end_tag

Examples
=====================================================
The following examples demonstrate various approaches for using resources in recipes. If you want to see examples of how Chef uses resources in recipes, take a closer look at the cookbooks that Chef authors and maintains: https://github.com/chef-cookbooks.

**Install a package**

.. tag resource_homebrew_package_install

.. To install a package:

.. code-block:: ruby

   homebrew_package 'name of package' do
     action :install
   end

.. end_tag

**Specify the Homebrew user with a UUID**

.. tag resource_homebrew_package_homebrew_user_as_uuid

.. To specify the Homebrew user as a UUID:

.. code-block:: ruby

   homebrew_package 'emacs' do
     homebrew_user 1001
   end
