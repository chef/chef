.. warning:: .. tag notes_provisioning

             This functionality is available with Chef provisioning and is packaged in the Chef development kit. Chef provisioning is a framework that allows clusters to be managed by the chef-client and the Chef server in the same way nodes are managed: with recipes. Use Chef provisioning to describe, version, deploy, and manage clusters of any size and complexity using a common set of tools.

             .. end_tag

.. tag chef_client_summary

A chef-client is an agent that runs locally on every node that is under management by Chef. When a chef-client is run, it will perform all of the steps that are required to bring the node into the expected state, including:

* Registering and authenticating the node with the Chef server
* Building the node object
* Synchronizing cookbooks
* Compiling the resource collection by loading each of the required cookbooks, including recipes, attributes, and all other dependencies
* Taking the appropriate and required actions to configure the node
* Looking for exceptions and notifications, handling each as required

.. end_tag

Use the **chef_mirror** resource to mirror objects in the chef-repo to a specified location.

Syntax
=====================================================
The syntax for using the **chef_mirror** resource in a recipe is as follows:

.. code-block:: ruby

   chef_mirror 'name' do
     attribute 'value' # see properties section below
     ...
     action :action # see actions section below
   end

where

* ``chef_mirror`` tells the chef-client to use the ``Chef::Provider::ChefMirror`` provider during the chef-client run
* ``name`` is the name of the resource block; when the ``path`` property is not specified as part of a recipe, ``name`` is also the name of the chef-client
* ``attribute`` is zero (or more) of the properties that are available for this resource
* ``action`` identifies which steps the chef-client will take to bring the node into the desired state

Actions
=====================================================
This resource has the following actions:

``:download``

``:nothing``
   .. tag resources_common_actions_nothing

   Define this resource block to do nothing until notified by another resource to take action. When this resource is notified, this resource block is either run immediately or it is queued up to be run at the end of the chef-client run.

   .. end_tag

``:upload``

Properties
=====================================================
This resource has the following properties:

``chef_repo_path``
   The path to the chef-repo.

``chef_server``
   The URL for the Chef server.

``concurrency``
   The number of threads to run in-parallel. Default value: ``10``.

``freeze``
   Use to freeze cookbooks upon upload to the mirrored location. When ``true``, cookbooks are frozen.

``ignore_failure``
   **Ruby Types:** TrueClass, FalseClass

   Continue running a recipe if a resource fails for any reason. Default value: ``false``.

``no_diff``
   Use to upload only new files.

``notifies``
   **Ruby Type:** Symbol, 'Chef::Resource[String]'

   .. tag resources_common_notification_notifies

   A resource may notify another resource to take action when its state changes. Specify a ``'resource[name]'``, the ``:action`` that resource should take, and then the ``:timer`` for that action. A resource may notifiy more than one resource; use a ``notifies`` statement for each resource to be notified.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag resources_common_notification_timers

   A timer specifies the point during the chef-client run at which a notification is run. The following timers are available:

   ``:before``
      Specifies that the action on a notified resource should be run before processing the resource block in which the notification is located.

   ``:delayed``
      Default. Specifies that a notification should be queued up, and then executed at the very end of the chef-client run.

   ``:immediate``, ``:immediately``
      Specifies that a notification should be run immediately, per resource notified.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag resources_common_notification_notifies_syntax

   The syntax for ``notifies`` is:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      notifies :action, 'resource[name]', :timer

   .. end_tag

``path``
   A path to a directory in the chef-repo to be mirrored. For example: ``nodes``, ``nodes/*``, ``/nodes/my_node``, ``*/*``, ``roles/base``, ``data/secrets``, ``cookbooks/apache2``, and so on.

``purge``
   Use to remove objects that have been deleted locally from the mirrored location. For example, when used with the ``:upload`` action, cookbooks that exist in the mirrored location, but do not exist locally, will be deleted.

``retries``
   **Ruby Type:** Integer

   The number of times to catch exceptions and retry the resource. Default value: ``0``.

``retry_delay``
   **Ruby Type:** Integer

   The retry delay (in seconds). Default value: ``2``.

``subscribes``
   **Ruby Type:** Symbol, 'Chef::Resource[String]'

   .. tag resources_common_notification_subscribes

   A resource may listen to another resource, and then take action if the state of the resource being listened to changes. Specify a ``'resource[name]'``, the ``:action`` to be taken, and then the ``:timer`` for that action.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag resources_common_notification_timers

   A timer specifies the point during the chef-client run at which a notification is run. The following timers are available:

   ``:before``
      Specifies that the action on a notified resource should be run before processing the resource block in which the notification is located.

   ``:delayed``
      Default. Specifies that a notification should be queued up, and then executed at the very end of the chef-client run.

   ``:immediate``, ``:immediately``
      Specifies that a notification should be run immediately, per resource notified.

   .. end_tag

   .. tag resources_common_notification_subscribes_syntax

   The syntax for ``subscribes`` is:

   .. code-block:: ruby

      subscribes :action, 'resource[name]', :timer

   .. end_tag

``versioned_cookbooks``
   Append cookbook versions to cookbooks. Set to ``false`` to hide cookbook versions: ``cookbooks/apache``. Set to ``true`` to show cookbook versions: ``cookbooks/apache-1.0.0`` and/or ``cookbooks/apache-1.0.1``. When this setting is ``true``, ``knife download`` downloads ALL cookbook versions, which can be useful if a full-fidelity backup of data on the Chef server is required. Defaults to ``true`` when ``chef_repo_path`` is specified, but this property is not.

Examples
=====================================================
None.
