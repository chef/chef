chef-docs hopes that the documentation is always just what you are looking for, but when that isn't the case chef-docs does appreciate feedback. There are several ways to get feedback to chef-docs. For members of the Chef community, customers, or people who just want to send feedback, choose any of the following four options:

* Email --- Send an email to docs@chef.io for documentation bugs, ideas, thoughts, and suggestions. Typos and little errors and quick fixes will be fixed quickly and without fuss. This email address is not a support email address, however. If you need support for Chef, contact Chef support.
* GitHub issues --- Use the https://github.com/chef/chef-web-docs/issues in the chef-docs repo on GitHub. If you believe the issue may be a product bug within Chef itself, consider using https://github.com/chef/chef/issues to raise the issue.
* GitHub pull request -- The documentation repository is on GitHub: https://github.com/chef/chef-web-docs. A DCO sign-off is not required to submit pull requests to this repo. If you have questions about the chef-docs repo, send an email to docs@chef.io and we're happy to assist.
* https://discourse.chef.io --- chef-docs follows the discussions at https://discourse.chef.io. Improvements to the documentation are made because of conversations that happen on this mailing list. That said, relying solely on the mailing list is the least effective way to get feedback to chef-docs (because there is no guarantee that chef-docs will see any particular message).

For internal members of Chef, to provide feedback about already-published content, a pull request or issue in GitHub is recommended unless the change is minor (sentence structure, typo, quick suggestion).

Thanks in advance for any feedback you choose to send.
