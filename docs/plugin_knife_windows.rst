knife windows
=====================================================
`[edit on GitHub] <https://github.com/chef/chef-web-docs/blob/master/chef_master/source/plugin_knife_windows.rst>`__

.. tag plugin_knife_windows_summary

The ``knife windows`` subcommand is used to configure and interact with nodes that exist on server and/or desktop machines that are running Microsoft Windows. Nodes are configured using WinRM, which allows native objects---batch scripts, Windows PowerShell scripts, or scripting library variables---to be called by external applications. The ``knife windows`` subcommand supports NTLM and Kerberos methods of authentication.

.. end_tag

.. note:: Review the list of :doc:`common options </knife_common_options>` available to this (and all) knife subcommands and plugins.

Install this plugin
=====================================================
.. tag plugin_knife_windows_install_rubygem

To install the ``knife windows`` plugin using RubyGems, run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ /opt/chef/embedded/bin/gem install knife-windows

where ``/opt/chef/embedded/bin/`` is the path to the location where the chef-client expects knife plugins to be located. If the chef-client was installed using RubyGems, omit the path in the previous example.

.. end_tag

Requirements
=====================================================
.. tag plugin_knife_windows_winrm_requirements

This subcommand requires WinRM to be installed, and then configured correctly, including ensuring the correct ports are open. For more information, see: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa384372(v=vs.85).aspx and/or http://support.microsoft.com/kb/968930. Use the quick configuration option in WinRM to allow outside connections and the entire network path from knife (and the workstation):

.. code-block:: bash

   $ winrm quickconfig -q

The following WinRM configuration settings should be updated:

.. list-table::
   :widths: 200 300
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Setting
     - Description
   * - ``MaxMemoryPerShellMB``
     - The chef-client and Ohai typically require more memory than the default setting allows. Increase this value to ``300MB``. Only required on Windows Server 2008 R2 Standard and older. The default in Windows Server 2012 was increased to ``1024MB``.
   * - ``MaxTimeoutms``
     - A bootstrap command can take longer than allowed by the default setting. Increase this value to ``1800000`` (30 minutes).
   * - ``AllowUnencrypted``
     - Set this value to ``true`` for development and testing purposes.
   * - ``Basic``
     - Set this value to ``true`` for development and testing purposes. The ``knife windows`` subcommand supports Kerberos and Basic authentication schemes.

To update these settings, run the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ winrm set winrm/config/winrs '@{MaxMemoryPerShellMB="300"}'

and:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ winrm set winrm/config '@{MaxTimeoutms="1800000"}'

and:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ winrm set winrm/config/service '@{AllowUnencrypted="true"}'

and then:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ winrm set winrm/config/service/auth '@{Basic="true"}'

Ensure that the Windows Firewall is configured to allow WinRM connections between the workstation and the Chef server. For example:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ netsh advfirewall firewall set rule name="Windows Remote Management (HTTP-In)" profile=public protocol=tcp localport=5985 remoteip=localsubnet new remoteip=any

.. end_tag

Negotiate, NTLM
-----------------------------------------------------
.. tag plugin_knife_windows_winrm_requirements_nltm

When knife is executed from a Microsoft Windows system, it is no longer necessary to make additional configuration of the WinRM listener on the target node to enable successful authentication from the workstation. It is sufficient to have a WinRM listener on the remote node configured to use the default configuration for ``winrm quickconfig``. This is because ``knife windows`` supports the Microsoft Windows negotiate protocol, including NTLM authentication, which matches the authentication requirements for the default configuration of the WinRM listener.

.. note:: To use Negotiate or NTLM to authenticate as the user specified by the ``--winrm-user`` option, include the user's Microsoft Windows domain, using the format ``domain\user``, where the backslash (``\``) separates the domain from the user.

For example:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ knife bootstrap windows winrm web1.cloudapp.net -r 'server::web' -x 'proddomain\webuser' -P 'password'

and:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ knife bootstrap windows winrm db1.cloudapp.net -r 'server::db' -x '.\localadmin' -P 'password'

.. end_tag

Domain Authentication
=====================================================
.. tag plugin_knife_windows_winrm_domain_authentication

The ``knife windows`` plugin supports Microsoft Windows domain authentication. This requires:

* An SSL certificate on the target node
* The certificate details can be viewed and its `thumbprint hex values copied <http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms788967.aspx>`_

To create the listener over HTTPS, run the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ winrm create winrm/config/Listener?Address=IP:<ip_address>+Transport=HTTPS @{Hostname="<fqdn>";CertificateThumbprint="<hexidecimal_thumbprint_value>"}

where the ``CertificateThumbprint`` is the thumbprint hex value copied from the certificate details. (The hex value may require that spaces be removed before passing them to the node using the ``knife windows`` plugin.) WinRM 2.0 uses port ``5985`` for HTTP and port ``5986`` for HTTPS traffic, by default.

To bootstrap the target node using the ``knife bootstrap`` subcommand, first use the ``winrm`` argument in the ``knife windows`` plugin to verify communication with the node:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ knife winrm 'node1.domain.com' 'dir' -m -x domain\\administrator -P 'super_secret_password' â€“p 5986

and then run a command similar to the following:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ knife bootstrap windows winrm 'node1.domain.com' -r 'role[webserver]' -x domain\\administrator -P 'password' -p 5986

.. end_tag

bootstrap windows ssh

**Find Uptime for Web Servers**

.. tag plugin_knife_windows_winrm_find_uptime

To find the uptime of all web servers, enter:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ knife winrm "role:web" "net stats srv" -x Administrator -P password

.. end_tag

**Force a chef-client run**

.. tag plugin_knife_windows_winrm_force_chef_run

To force a chef-client run:

.. code-block:: bash

   knife winrm 'ec2-50-xx-xx-124.amazonaws.com' 'chef-client -c c:/chef/client.rb' -m -x admin -P 'password'
   ec2-50-xx-xx-124.amazonaws.com [date] INFO: Starting Chef Run (Version 0.9.12)

Where in the examples above, ``[date]`` represents the date and time the long entry was created. For example: ``[Fri, 04 Mar 2011 22:00:53 +0000]``.

.. end_tag

**Bootstrap a Windows machine using SSH**

.. tag plugin_knife_windows_bootstrap_ssh

To bootstrap a Microsoft Windows machine using SSH:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ knife bootstrap windows ssh ec2-50-xx-xx-124.compute-1.amazonaws.com -r 'role[webserver],role[production]' -x Administrator -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa

.. end_tag

**Bootstrap a Windows machine using Windows Remote Management**

.. tag plugin_knife_windows_bootstrap_winrm

To bootstrap a Microsoft Windows machine using WinRM:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ knife bootstrap windows winrm ec2-50-xx-xx-124.compute-1.amazonaws.com -r 'role[webserver],role[production]' -x Administrator -P 'super_secret_password'

.. end_tag

**Generate an SSL certificate, and then create a listener**

Use the ``listener create``, ``cert generate``, and ``cert install`` arguments to create a new listener and assign it a newly-generated SSL certificate. First, make sure that WinRM is enabled on the machine:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ winrm quickconfig

Create the SSL certificate

.. code-block:: bash

   $ knife windows cert generate --domain myorg.org --output-file $env:userprofile/winrmcerts/winrm-ssl

This command may be run on any machine and will output three file types: ``.b64``, ``.pem``, and ``.pfx``.

Next, create the SSL listener:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ knife windows listener create --hostname *.myorg.org --cert-install $env:userprofile/winrmcerts/winrm-ssl.pfx

This will use the same ``.pfx`` file that was output by the ``cert generate`` argument. If the command is run on a different machine from that which generated the certificates, the required certificate files must first be transferred securely to the system on which the listener will be created. (Use the ``cert install`` argument to install a certificate on a machine.)

The SSL listener is created and should be listening on TCP port ``5986``, which is the default WinRM SSL port.
