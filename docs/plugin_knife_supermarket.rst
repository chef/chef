knife supermarket
=====================================================
`[edit on GitHub] <https://github.com/chef/chef-web-docs/blob/master/chef_master/source/plugin_knife_supermarket.rst>`__

.. warning:: Only use knife supermarket if you are using a Chef 12.12 or earlier. If you are using Chef 12.13 or later, you should use the :doc:`knife cookbook site </knife_cookbook_site>` commands.

.. tag supermarket_api_summary

The Supermarket API is used to provide access to cookbooks, tools, and users on the Chef Supermarket at |url supermarket_cookbooks|. All of the cookbooks, tools, and users on the Supermarket are accessible through a RESTful API located at |url supermarket_api| by using any of the supported endpoints. In most cases, using knife is the best way to interact with the Supermarket; in some cases, using the Supermarket API directly is necessary.

.. end_tag

The ``knife supermarket`` subcommand is used to interact with cookbooks that are located in private Chef Supermarket configured inside the firewall. A user account is required for any community actions that write data to the Chef Supermarket; however, the following arguments do not require a user account: ``download``, ``search``, ``install``, and ``list``.

.. note:: If you are interested in uploading to the supermarket as a company you might be interested
          in looking at the `Chef Partner Cookbook Program <https://www.chef.io/partners/cookbooks/>`__
          which can help validate and verify your company cookbook. A selection of Certified Partner Cookbooks can
          be found `here <https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks?utf8=âœ“&q=&badges%5B%5D=partner&platforms%5B%5D=>`__.

.. note:: .. tag notes_knife_cookbook_site_use_devkit_berkshelf

          Please consider managing community cookbooks using the version of Berkshelf that ships with the Chef development kit. For more information about the Chef development kit, see /about_chefdk.html.

          .. end_tag

.. note:: Review the list of `common options </knife_common_options>`_ available to this (and all) knife subcommands and plugins.

download
=====================================================
Use the ``download`` argument to download a cookbook from Chef Supermarket. A cookbook will be downloaded as a tar.gz archive and placed in the current working directory. If a cookbook (or cookbook version) has been deprecated and the ``--force`` option is not used, knife will alert the user that the cookbook is deprecated and then will provide the name of the most recent non-deprecated version of that cookbook.

Syntax
-----------------------------------------------------
This argument has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ knife supermarket download COOKBOOK_NAME [COOKBOOK_VERSION] (options)

Options
-----------------------------------------------------
This argument has the following options:

``COOKBOOK_VERSION``
   The version of a cookbook to be downloaded. If a cookbook has only one version, this option does not need to be specified. If a cookbook has more than one version and this option is not specified, the most recent version of the cookbook is downloaded.

``-f FILE``, ``--file FILE``
   The file to which a cookbook download is written.

``--force``
   Overwrite an existing directory.

``-m``, ``--supermarket-site``
   The URL at which the Chef Supermarket is located. Default value: ``https://supermarket.chef.io``.

Examples
-----------------------------------------------------
The following examples show how to use this knife subcommand:

**Download a cookbook**

To download the cookbook ``mysql``, enter:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ knife supermarket download mysql

install
=====================================================
Use the ``install`` argument to install a cookbook that has been downloaded from Chef Supermarket to a local git repository . This action uses the git version control system in conjunction with Chef Supermarket site to install community-contributed cookbooks to the local chef-repo. Using this argument does the following:

  #. A new "pristine copy" branch is created in git for tracking the upstream.
  #. All existing versions of a cookbook are removed from the branch.
  #. The cookbook is downloaded from Chef Supermarket in the tar.gz format.
  #. The downloaded cookbook is untarred and its contents are committed to git and a tag is created.
  #. The "pristine copy" branch is merged into the master branch.

This process allows the upstream cookbook in the master branch to be modified while letting git maintain changes as a separate patch. When an updated upstream version becomes available, those changes can be merged while maintaining any local modifications.

Syntax
-----------------------------------------------------
This argument has the following syntax:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ knife supermarket install COOKBOOK_NAME [COOKBOOK_VERSION] (options)

   The version of the cookbook to be installed. If a version is not specified, the most recent version of the cookbook is installed.

``-D``, ``--skip-dependencies``
   Ensure that all cookbooks to which the installed cookbook has a dependency are not installed.

``-m``, ``--supermarket-site``
   The URL at which the Chef Supermarket is located. Default value: ``https://supermarket.chef.io``.

``-o PATH:PATH``, ``--cookbook-path PATH:PATH``
