MOCKUPS
-------
The mockups directory is used to store Balsamiq Mockups
projects. To create a new Balsamiq Mockups project for
the WebUI, execute the rake task `rake new_mockup[project_name]`
from the chef-server-webui sub-directory of the chef project.

This rake task will copy templates and assets from the
`mockups/base-mockup` folder into your destination project
directory.

structure described above is inspired by:
