  %h4 Where do I get a Login?
  %p Any existing Admin level user can create new users. 
  %p To create the first user, please login with the default admin credential, which by default is: 
  %p username: admin, password: p@ssw0rd1 (May be different if you've set it in Chef::Config)
  %b Please change the default password immediately after logging in!
  %p Once you have an User, you can associate an OpenID with the User and login using the OpenID as the User.
  %p Administrators can associate OpenID to any User.
