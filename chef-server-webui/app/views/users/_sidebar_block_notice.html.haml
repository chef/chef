%h4 Where do I get a Login?
%p Any existing Admin level user can create new users.
%p To create the first user, please login with the default admin credential, which by default is:
%p username: admin, password: p@ssw0rd1 (May be different if you've set it in Chef::Config)
%b Please change the default password immediately after logging in!
%p Once you have an User, you can associate an OpenID with the User and login using the OpenID as the User.
%p Administrators can associate OpenID to any User.
