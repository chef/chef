# The goal of these tests is to make sure that loading resources from a file creates the necessary notifications.
# Then once converge has started, both immediate and delayed notifications are called as the resources are converged.
# We want to do this WITHOUT actually converging any resources - we don't want to take time changing the system,
# we just want to make sure the run_context, the notification DSL and the converge hooks are working together
# to perform notifications.

# This test is extremely fragile since it mocks MANY different systems at once - any of them changes, this test
# breaks
