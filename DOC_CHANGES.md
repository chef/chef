### value_for_platform Method

- where <code>"platform"</code> can be a comma-separated list, each specifying a platform, such as Red Hat, openSUSE, or Fedora, <code>version</code> specifies the version of that platform, and <code>value</code> specifies the value that will be used if the node's platform matches the <code>value_for_platform</code> method. If each value only has a single platform, then the syntax is like the following:
+ where <code>platform</code> can be a comma-separated list, each specifying a platform, such as Red Hat, openSUSE, or Fedora, <code>version</code> specifies either the exact version of that platform, or a constraint to match the platform's version against. The following rules apply to constraint matches:

+ *  Exact matches take precedence no matter what, and should never throw exceptions.
+ *  Matching multiple constraints raises a <code>RuntimeError</code>.
+ *  The following constraints are allowed: <code><,<=,>,>=,~></code>.
+ 
+ The following is an example of using the method with constraints:
+ 
+ ```ruby
+ value_for_platform(
+   "os1" => {
+     "< 1.0" => "less than 1.0",
+     "~> 2.0" => "version 2.x",
+     ">= 3.0" => "version 3.0",
+     "3.0.1" => "3.0.1 will always use this value" }
+ )
+ ```

+ If each value only has a single platform, then the syntax is like the following:

### Metadata `name` Attribute is Required.

Current documentation states:

> The name of the cookbook. This field is inferred unless specified.

This is no longer correct as of 12.0. The `name` field is required; if
it is not specified, an error will be raised if it is not specified.

### chef-zero port ranges

- to avoid crashes, by default, Chef will now scan a port range and take the first available port from 8889-9999.
- to change this behavior, you can pass --chef-zero-port=PORT_RANGE (for example, 10,20,30 or 10000-20000) or modify Chef::Config.chef_zero.port to be a po
rt string, an enumerable of ports, or a single port number.

### Encrypted Data Bags Version 3

Encrypted Data Bag version 3 uses [GCM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galois/Counter_Mode) internally. Ruby 2 and OpenSSL version 1.0.1 or higher are required to use it.

### New windows_service resource

The windows_service resource inherits from the service resource and has all the same options but adds an action and attribute.

action :configure_startup - sets the startup type on the resource to the value of the `startup_type` attribute
attribute startup_type - the value as a symbol that the startup type should be set to on the service, valid options :automatic, :manual, :disabled

Note that the service resource will also continue to set the startup type to automatic or disabled, respectively, when the enabled or disabled actions are used.
