###############################################################################
# Notes on the tags inside CHANGELOG.md
###############################################################################
# latest_release
#   The content inside this block contains the most recent Pull Request to be
#   merged into the repository. When the `built_in:update_changelog` merge_action
#   is triggered, the content of this block is updated to reflect the most recent
#   Pull Request merged.
#
# release_rollup
#   This block contains all the Pull Requests merged since the most recent
#   Stable release. When the `built_in:update_changelog` merge_action is triggered,
#   the content inside this block is updated to include the most recent Pull Request
#   merged. When the `built_in:rollover_changelog` artifact_action is trggered,
#   the line items (each `-` line) are evaluated based on the version in the tags
#   at the end of the line (e.g.  `<!-- 13.0.0 -->`). If the version is more recent
#   than the version that was just promoted (e.g. `> STABLE`), it is left in the
#   release_rollup section. Otherwise, it is moved into the `latest_stable_release`
#   section.
#
# latest_stable_release
#   This block contains a list of all the changes that were released in the latest
#   stable version. When the `built_in:rollover_changelog` artifact_action is triggerd,
#   the content inside this block is moved underneath it and the block is updated with
#   all of the line item chanages from the `release_rollup` block that were included in
#   the just released stable build (e.g. `> STABLE-1, <= STABLE`)
#
