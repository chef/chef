Chef is a configuration management tool designed to bring automation to your
entire infrastructure.

This README focuses on developers who want to modify Chef source code.
If you just want to use Chef, check out these resources:

* [learnchef](https://learnchef.opscode.com): Getting started guide
* [http://docs.opscode.com](http://docs.opscode.com): Comprehensive User Docs
* [Installer Downloads](http://www.getchef.com/chef/install/): Install Chef as a complete package

## Installing From Git

**NOTE:** Unless you have a specific reason to install from source (to
try a new feature, contribute a patch, or run chef on an OS for which no
package is available), you should head to the [installer page](http://www.getchef.com/chef/install/)
to get a prebuilt package.

### Prerequisites

Install these via your platform's preferred method (apt, yum, ports,
emerge, etc.):

* git
* C compiler, header files, etc. On Ubuntu/Debian, use the
  `build-essential` package.
* ruby 2.0.0 or later
* rubygems
* bundler

### Chef Installation

Then get the source and install it:

    # Clone this repo
    git clone https://github.com/opscode/chef.git
    
    # cd into the source tree
    cd chef

    # Install dependencies with bundler
    bundle install

    # Build a gem
    rake gem

    # Install the gem you just built
    gem install pkg/chef-VERSION.gem


## Contributing/Development

Before working on the code, if you plan to contribute your changes, you need to
read the
[Chef Contributions document](http://docs.opscode.com/community_contributions.html).

You will also need to set up the repository with the appropriate branches. We
document the process on the
[Working with Git](http://wiki.opscode.com/display/chef/Working+with+git) page
of the Chef wiki.

Once your repository is set up, you can start working on the code. We do use
TDD with RSpec, so you'll need to get a development environment running.
Follow the above procedure ("Installing from Git") to get your local
copy of the source running.

## Testing

We use RSpec for unit/spec tests. It is not necessary to start the development
environment to run the specs--they are completely standalone.

    # Run All the Tests
    bundle exec rake spec

    # Run a Single Test File
    bundle exec rspec spec/PATH/TO/FILE_spec.rb

    # Run a Subset of Tests
    bundle exec rspec spec/PATH/TO/DIR
