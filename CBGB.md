# Chef Board of Governance (CBGB)

  Chef was designed from the outset to have a very open structure, including open design, open contribution, and consistent use of tools across the project. Given the large numbers of contributors, users, and companies with a stake in the future of the project, Chef leadership has established an advisory board, as part of its long term commitment to open governance.

  The Chef Board of Governance (CBGB) shall advise the Leadership on matters related to supporting the long-term governance, structure, and roadmap of the Project.

More information can be found in the [Chef Board of Governance RFC](Chef Board of Governance).
