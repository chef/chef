require "webrick/utils"
#    Webrick uses a centralized/synchronized timeout manager. It works by
#    starting a thread to check for timeouts on an interval. The timeout
#    checker thread cannot be stopped or canceled in any easy way, and it
#    makes calls to Time.new, which fail when rspec is in the process of
#    creating a method stub for that method. Since our tests don't rely on
#    any timeout behavior enforced by webrick, disable the timeout manager
#    via a monkey patch.
#
#    Hopefully this fails loudly if the webrick code should change. As of this
#    writing, the relevant code is in webrick/utils, which can be located on
#    your system with:
#
#    $ gem which webrick/utils
module WEBrick
  module Utils
