.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Chef Expander fetches messages from RabbitMQ, processes them into the correct format to be loaded into Solr and loads them into Solr\.
.
.P
\fBRunning Chef Expander\fR
.
.P
Chef Expander is designed for clustered operation, though small installations will only need one worker process\. To run Chef Expander with one worker process, run chef\-expander \-n 1\. You will then have a master and worker process, which looks like this in ps:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

your\-shell> ps aux|grep expander
you   52110   0\.1  0\.7  2515476  62748 s003  S+    3:49PM   0:00\.80 chef\-expander worker #1 (vnodes 0\-1023)
you   52108   0\.1  0\.5  2492880  41696 s003  S+    3:49PM   0:00\.91 ruby bin/chef\-expander \-n 1

.P
Workers are single threaded and therefore cannot use more than 100% of a single CPU\. If you find that your queues are getting backlogged, increase the number of workers
.
.P
\fBDesign\fR
.
.P
Chef Expander uses 1024 queues (called vnodes in some places) to allow you to scale the number of Chef Expander workers to meet the needs of your infrastructure\. When objects are saved in the API server, they are added to queues based on their database IDs\. These queues can be assigned to different Chef Expander workers to distribute the load of processing the index updates\.
.
.P
\fBChef Expander Operation and Troubleshooting\fR
.
.P
Chef Expander includes chef\-expanderctl, a management program that allows you to get status information or change the logging verbosity (without restarting)\.
.
.P
See \fBchef\-expanderctl\fR(8) for details\.
