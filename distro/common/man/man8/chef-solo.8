chef\-solo is an open source version of the chef\-client that allows using cookbooks with nodes without requiring access to a Chef server\&. chef\-solo runs locally and requires that a cookbook (and any of its dependencies) be on the same physical disk as the node. chef\-solo is a limited\-functionality version of the chef\-client and \fBdoes not support\fP the following:
.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
Node data storage
.IP \(bu 2
Search indexes
.IP \(bu 2
Centralized distribution of cookbooks
.IP \(bu 2
A centralized API that interacts with and integrates infrastructure components
.IP \(bu 2
Authentication or authorization
.IP \(bu 2

.sp
This command has the following options:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB\-c CONFIG\fP, \fB\-\-config CONFIG\fP
The configuration file to use.
.TP
.B \fB\-d\fP, \fB\-\-daemonize\fP
Indicates that the executable will be run as a daemon. This option is only available on machines that run in UNIX or Linux environments. For machines that are running Microsoft Windows that require similar functionality, use the \fBchef\-client::service\fP recipe in the \fBchef\-client\fP cookbook: \fI\%http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks/chef\-client\fP\&. This will install a chef\-client service under Microsoft Windows using the Windows Service Wrapper\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-E ENVIRONMENT_NAME\fP, \fB\-\-environment ENVIRONMENT_NAME\fP
The name of the environment.
.TP
.B \fB\-f\fP, \fB\-\-[no\-]fork\fP
Indicates that a chef\-client run will be contained in a secondary process with dedicated RAM. When the chef\-client run is complete the RAM will be returned to the master process. This option helps ensure that a chef\-client will use a steady amount of RAM over time because the master process will not run recipes. This option will also help prevent memory leaks (such as those that can be introduced by the code contained within a poorly designed cookbook). Use \fB\-\-no\-fork\fP to disable running the chef\-client in fork node. Default value: \fB\-\-fork\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-F FORMAT\fP, \fB\-\-format FORMAT\fP
The output format: \fBdoc\fP (default) or \fBmin\fP\&.
.sp
Use \fBdoc\fP to print the progress of the chef\-client run using full strings that display a summary of updates as they occur.
.sp
Use \fBmin\fP to print the progress of the chef\-client run using single characters. A summary of updates is printed at the end of the chef\-client run. A dot (\fB\&.\fP) is printed for events that do not have meaningful status information, such as loading a file or synchronizing a cookbook. For resources, a dot (\fB\&.\fP) is printed when the resource is up to date, an \fBS\fP is printed when the resource is skipped by \fBnot_if\fP or \fBonly_if\fP, and a \fBU\fP is printed when the resource is updated.
.sp
Other formatting options are available when those formatters are configured in the client.rb file using the \fBadd_formatter\fP option.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-force\-formatter\fP
Indicates that formatter output will be used instead of logger output.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-force\-logger\fP
Indicates that logger output will be used instead of formatter output.
.TP
.B \fB\-g GROUP\fP, \fB\-\-group GROUP\fP
The name of the group that owns a process. This is required when starting any executable as a daemon.
.TP
.B \fB\-h\fP, \fB\-\-help\fP
Shows help for the command.
.TP
.B \fB\-i SECONDS\fP, \fB\-\-interval SECONDS\fP
The frequency (in seconds) at which the chef\-client runs.
.TP
.B \fB\-j PATH\fP, \fB\-\-json\-attributes PATH\fP
The path to a file that contains JSON data. Use this option to override \fBnormal\fP attributes set elsewhere.
.TP
.B \fB\-l LEVEL\fP, \fB\-\-log_level LEVEL\fP
The level of logging that will be stored in a log file.
.TP
.B \fB\-L LOGLOCATION\fP, \fB\-\-logfile c\fP
The location in which log file output files will be saved. If this location is set to something other than \fBSTDOUT\fP, standard output logging will still be performed (otherwise there would be no output other than to a file). This is recommended when starting any executable as a daemon.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-[no\-]color\fP
Indicates whether colored output will be used. Default setting: \fB\-\-color\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-N NODE_NAME\fP, \fB\-\-node\-name NODE_NAME\fP
The name of the node.
.TP
.B \fB\-o RUN_LIST_ITEM\fP, \fB\-\-override\-runlist RUN_LIST_ITEM\fP
Replace the current run list with the specified items.
.TP
.B \fB\-r RECIPE_URL\fP, \fB\-\-recipe\-url RECIPE_URL\fP
The URL location from which a remote cookbook tar.gz will be downloaded.
.TP
.B \fB\-s SECONDS\fP, \fB\-\-splay SECONDS\fP
A number (in seconds) to add to the \fBinterval\fP that is used to determine the frequency of chef\-client runs. This number can help prevent server load when there are many clients running at the same time.
.TP
.B \fB\-u USER\fP, \fB\-\-user USER\fP
The user that owns a process. This is required when starting any executable as a daemon.
.TP
.B \fB\-v\fP, \fB\-\-version\fP
The version of the chef\-client\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-W\fP, \fB\-\-why\-run\fP
Indicates that the executable will be run in why\-run mode, which is a type of chef\-client run that does everything except modify the system. Use why\-run mode to understand why the chef\-client makes the decisions that it makes and to learn more about the current and proposed state of the system.
