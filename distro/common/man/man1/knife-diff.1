The \fBknife diff\fP subcommand is used to compare the differences between files and directories on the server and in the chef\-repo. For example, to compare files on the server prior to an uploading or downloading files using the \fBknife download\fP and \fBknife upload\fP subcommands, or to ensure that certain files in multiple production environments are the same. This subcommand is similar to the \fBgit diff\fP command that can be used to diff what is in the chef\-repo with what is synced to a git repository.
