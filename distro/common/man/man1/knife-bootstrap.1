.INDENT 3.5
The default bootstrap operation uses the omnibus installer, which means the default template file (\fBchef\-full\fP) should work on all supported platforms.

When this option is used, Knife will search for the template file in the following order: the \fBbootstrap/\fP folder in the current working directory, the \fBbootstrap/\fP folder in the chef\-repo, the \fBbootstrap/\fP folder in the \fB~/.chef/\fP directory, or a default bootstrap file.
