The \fBknife ssl fetch\fP subcommand is used to copy SSL certificates from an HTTPS server to the \fBtrusted_certs_dir\fP directory that is used by knife and the chef\-client to store trusted SSL certificates. When these certificates match the hostname of the remote server, running \fBknife ssl fetch\fP is the only step required to verify a remote server that is accessed by either knife or the chef\-client\&.
.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
It is the user\(aqs responsibility to verify the authenticity of every SSL certificate before downloading it to the \fBtrusted_certs_dir\fP directory. knife will use any certificate in that directory as if it is a 100% trusted and authentic SSL certificate. knife will not be able to determine if any certificate in this directory has been tampered with, is forged, malicious, or otherwise harmful. Therefore it is essential that users take the proper steps before downloading certificates into this directory.
