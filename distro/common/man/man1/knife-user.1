The \fBknife user\fP subcommand is used to manage the list of users and their associated RSA public key\-pairs.
.IP Note
This subcommand ONLY works when run against the open source server version 10.x. This subcommand will NOT run against open source server 11, Enterprise Chef (including hosted Enterprise Chef), or Private Chef.

.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
For the user, the private key should be copied to the system as \fB/etc/chef/client.pem\fP.
.IP \(bu 2
