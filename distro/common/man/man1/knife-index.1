Rebuilds all the search indexes on the server\. This is accomplished by deleting all objects from the search index, and then forwarding each item in the database to \fBchef\-expander\fR(8) via \fBrabbitmq\-server\fR(1)\. Depending on the number of objects in the database, it may take some time for all objects to be indexed and available for search\.
