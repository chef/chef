.sp
The \fBknife serve\fP subcommand is used to run a persistent chef\-zero against the local chef\-repo\&. (chef\-zero is a lightweight Chef server that runs in\-memory on the local machine.) This is the same as running the chef\-client executable with the \fB\-\-local\-mode\fP option. The \fBchef_repo_path\fP is located automatically and the Chef server will bind to the first available port between \fB8889\fP and \fB9999\fP\&. \fBknife serve\fP will print the URL for the local Chef server, so that it may be added to the knife.rb file.
