.sp
The \fBknife serve\fP subcommand is used to run a persistent chef\-zero against the local chef\-repo\&. (chef\-zero is a lightweight Chef server that runs in\-memory on the local machine.) This is the same as running the chef\-client executable with the \fB\-\-local\-mode\fP option. The \fBchef_repo_path\fP is located automatically and the Chef server will bind to port \fB8900\fP by default. \fBknife serve\fP will print the URL for the local Chef server, so that it may be added to the knife.rb file.
