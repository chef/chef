.P
Knife also includes commands that take actions other than displaying or modifying data on the Chef Server, such as \fBknife\-ssh(1)\fR\.
.
.SH "CONFIGURATION"
The knife configuration file is a Ruby DSL to set configuration parameters for Knife\'s \fBGENERAL OPTIONS\fR\. The default location for the config file is \fB~/\.chef/knife\.rb\fR\. If managing multiple Chef repositories, per\-repository config files can be created\. The file must be \fB\.chef/knife\.rb\fR in the current directory of the repository\.
.
.P
If the config file exists, knife uses these settings for \fBGENERAL OPTIONS\fR defaults\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBnode_name\fR: User or client identity (i\.e\., \fIname\fR) to use for authenticating requests to the Chef Server\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBclient_key\fR: Private key file to authenticate to the Chef server\. Corresponds to the \fB\-k\fR or \fB\-\-key\fR option\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBchef_server_url\fR: URL of the Chef server\. Corresponds to the \fB\-s\fR or \fB\-\-server\-url\fR option\. This is requested from the user when running this sub\-command\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBsyntax_check_cache_path\fR: Specifies the path to a directory where knife caches information about files that it has syntax checked\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBvalidation_client_name\fR: Specifies the name of the client used to validate new clients\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBvalidation_key\fR: Specifies the private key file to use when bootstrapping new hosts\. See knife\-client(1) for more information about the validation client\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fBcookbook_copyright\fR, \fBcookbook_email\fR, \fBcookbook_license\fR, \fBreadme_format\fR Used by \fBknife cookbook create\fR sub\-command to specify the copyright holder, maintainer email, license and readme format (respectively) for new cookbooks\. The copyright holder is listed as the maintainer in the cookbook\'s metadata and as the Copyright in the comments of the default recipe\. The maintainer email is used in the cookbook metadata\. The license determines what preamble to put in the comment of the default recipe, and is listed as the license in the cookbook metadata\. Currently supported licenses are "apachev2" and "none"\. Any other values will result in an empty license in the metadata (needs to be filled in by the author), and no comment preamble in the default recipe\. Currently supported readme formats are "md", "mkd", "txt", and "rdoc"\. Any other value will result in an unformatted README\.

.P
Ruby DSL configuration file for knife\. See \fBCONFIGURATION\fR\.
.
.SH "FORMATS"
The amount of content displayed and the output format are modified by the \fB\-\-format\fR option\. If no alternate format is selected, the default is summary\.
.
.P
Valid formats are:
.
.TP
\fBsummary\fR
displays the node in a custom, summarized format (default)
.
.TP
\fBtext\fR
displays the node data in its entirety using the colorized tree display
.
.TP
\fBjson\fR
displays the node in JSON format
.
.TP
\fByaml\fR
displays the node in YAML format
.
.TP
\fBpp\fR
displays the node using Ruby\'s pretty printer\.
.
.P
For brevity, only the first character of the format is required, for example, \-Fj will produce JSON format output\.
.
.SH "CHEF WORKFLOW"
When working with Chef and Knife in the local repository, the recommended workflow outline looks like:
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Create repository\. A skeleton sample is provided at \fIhttp://github\.com/opscode/chef\-repo/\fR\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Configure knife, see \fBCONFIGURATION\fR\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Download cookbooks from the Opscode cookbooks site, see \fBCOOKBOOK SITE SUB\-COMMANDS\fR\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Or, create new cookbooks, see \fBcookbook create\fR sub\-command\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Commit changes to the version control system\. See your tool\'s documentation\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Upload cookbooks to the Chef Server, see \fBCOOKBOOK SUB\-COMMANDS\fR\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Launch instances in the Cloud, OR provision new hosts; see \fBCLOUD COMPUTING SUB\-COMMANDS\fR and \fBBOOTSTRAP SUB\-COMMANDS\fR\.
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Watch Chef configure systems!
.

.
.P
A note about git: Opscode and many folks in the Chef community use git, but it is not required, except in the case of the \fBcookbook site vendor\fR sub\-command, as it uses git directly\. Version control is strongly recommended though, and git fits with a lot of the workflow paradigms\.
.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.
.SH "ENVIRONMENT"
.
.TP
\fBEDITOR\fR
The text editor to use for editing data\. The \-\-editor option takes precedence over this value, and the \-\-disable\-editing option supresses data editing entirely\.
.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
