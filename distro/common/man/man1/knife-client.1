.sp
Every request made by the chef\-client to the Chef server must be an authenticated request using the Chef server API and a private key. When the chef\-client makes a request to the Chef server, the chef\-client authenticates each request using a private key located in \fB/etc/chef/client.pem\fP\&.
.sp
However, during the first chef\-client run, this private key does not exist. Instead, the chef\-client will attempt to use the private key assigned to the chef\-validator, located in \fB/etc/chef/validation.pem\fP\&. (If, for any reason, the chef\-validator is unable to make an authenticated request to the Chef server, the initial chef\-client run will fail.)
.sp
During the initial chef\-client run, the chef\-client will register with the Chef server using the private key assigned to the chef\-validator, after which the chef\-client will obtain a \fBclient.pem\fP private key for all future authentication requests to the Chef server\&.
.sp
After the initial chef\-client run has completed successfully, the chef\-validator is no longer required and may be deleted from the node. Use the \fBdelete_validation\fP recipe found in the \fBchef\-client\fP cookbook (\fI\%https://github.com/chef\-cookbooks/chef\-client\fP) to remove the chef\-validator\&.
.sp
The \fBknife client\fP subcommand is used to manage an API client list and their associated RSA public key\-pairs. This allows authentication requests to be made to the Chef server by any entity that uses the Chef server API, such as the chef\-client and knife\&.
.SH COMMON OPTIONS
.sp
The following options may be used with any of the arguments available to the \fBknife client\fP subcommand:
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB\-\-chef\-zero\-port PORT\fP
The port on which chef\-zero will listen.
.TP
.B \fB\-c CONFIG_FILE\fP, \fB\-\-config CONFIG_FILE\fP
The configuration file to use.
.TP
.B \fB\-d\fP, \fB\-\-disable\-editing\fP
Use to prevent the $EDITOR from being opened and to accept data as\-is.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-defaults\fP
Use to have knife use the default value instead of asking a user to provide one.

.B \fB\-e EDITOR\fP, \fB\-\-editor EDITOR\fP
The $EDITOR that is used for all interactive commands.
.TP
.B \fB\-E ENVIRONMENT\fP, \fB\-\-environment ENVIRONMENT\fP
The name of the environment. When this option is added to a command, the command will run only against the named environment.
.TP
.B \fB\-F FORMAT\fP, \fB\-\-format FORMAT\fP
The output format: \fBsummary\fP (default), \fBtext\fP, \fBjson\fP, \fByaml\fP, and \fBpp\fP\&.

.B \fB\-h\fP, \fB\-\-help\fP
Shows help for the command.
.TP
.B \fB\-k KEY\fP, \fB\-\-key KEY\fP
The private key that knife will use to sign requests made by the API client to the Chef server\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-[no\-]color\fP

.B \fB\-s URL\fP, \fB\-\-server\-url URL\fP
The URL for the Chef server\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-u USER\fP, \fB\-\-user USER\fP

.TP
.B \fB\-V\fP, \fB\-\-verbose\fP

.TP
.B \fB\-v\fP, \fB\-\-version\fP
The version of the chef\-client\&.
.TP

Use to respond to all confirmation prompts with "Yes". knife will not ask for confirmation.
.TP
.B \fB\-z\fP, \fB\-\-local\-mode\fP

.UNINDENT
.SH BULK DELETE

.INDENT 0.0
.IP \(bu 2
For the chef\-client, the private key should be copied to the system as \fB/etc/chef/client.pem\fP\&.
