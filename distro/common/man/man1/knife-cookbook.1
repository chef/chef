.
.P
List available recipes from the server\. Specify \fIPATTERN\fR as a regular expression to limit the results\.
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Cookbooks are the fundamental unit of distribution in Chef\. They encapsulate all recipes of resources and assets used to configure a particular aspect of the infrastructure\. The following sub\-commands can be used to manipulate the cookbooks stored on the Chef Server\.
.
.P
On disk, cookbooks are directories with a defined structure\. The following directories may appear within a cookbook:
.
.TP
COOKBOOK/attributes/
Ruby files that define default parameters to be used in recipes
.
.TP
COOKBOOK/definitions/
Ruby files that contain \fIresource definitions\fR
.
.TP
COOKBOOK/files/SPECIFICITY
Files of arbitrary type\. These files may be downloaded by chef\-client(8) when configuring a host\.
.
.TP
COOKBOOK/libraries/
Ruby files that contain library code needed for recipes
.
.TP
COOKBOOK/providers/
Ruby files that contain Lightweight Provider definitions
.
.TP
COOKBOOK/recipes/
Ruby files that use Chef\'s recipe DSL to describe the desired configuration of a system
.
.TP
COOKBOOK/resources/
Ruby files that contain Lightweight Resource definitions
.
.TP
COOKBOOK/templates/SPECIFICITY
ERuby (ERb) template files\. These are referenced by \fIrecipes\fR and evaluated to dynamically generate configuration files\.
.
.P
\fBSPECIFICITY\fR is a feature of \fIfiles\fR and \fItemplates\fR that allow you to specify alternate files to be used on a specific OS platform or host\. The default specificity setting is \fIdefault\fR, that is files in \fBCOOKBOOK/files/default\fR will be used when a more specific copy is not available\. Further documentation for this feature is available on the Chef wiki: \fIhttp://wiki\.opscode\.com/display/chef/File+Distribution#FileDistribution\-FileSpecificity\fR
.
.P
Cookbooks also contain a metadata file that defines various properties of the cookbook\. The most important of these are the \fIversion\fR and the \fIdependencies\fR\. The \fIversion\fR is used in combination with environments to select which copy of a given cookbook is distributed to a node\. The \fIdependencies\fR are used by the server to determine which additional cookbooks must be distributed to a given host when it requires a cookbook\.
