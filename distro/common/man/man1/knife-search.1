.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Search is a feature of the Chef Server that allows you to use a full\-text search engine to query information about your infrastructure and applications\. You can utilize this service via search calls in a recipe or the knife search command\. The search syntax is based on Lucene\.
.
.SH "INDEXES"
Search indexes are a feature of the Chef Server and the search sub\-command allows querying any of the available indexes using SOLR query syntax\. The following data types are indexed for search:
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fInode\fR
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fIrole\fR
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fIenvironment\fR
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fIclients\fR
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\fIdata bag\fR
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
Data bags are indexed by the data bag\'s name\. For example, to search a data bag named "admins":
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

knife search admins "field:search_pattern"
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.SH "QUERY SYNTAX"
Queries have the form \fBfield:search_pattern\fR where \fBfield\fR is a key in the JSON description of the relevant objects (nodes, roles, environments, or data bags)\. Both \fBfield\fR and \fBsearch_pattern\fR are case\-sensitive\. \fBsearch_pattern\fR can be an exact, wildcard, range, or fuzzy match (see below)\. The \fBfield\fR supports exact matching and limited wildcard matching\.
.
.P
Searches will return the relevant objects (nodes, roles, environments, or data bags) where the \fBsearch_pattern\fR matches the object\'s value of \fBfield\fR\.
.
.SS "FIELD NAMES"
Field names are the keys within the JSON description of the object being searched\. Nested Keys can be searched by placing an underscore ("_") between key names\.
.
.SS "WILDCARD MATCHING FOR FIELD NAMES"
The field name also has limited support for wildcard matching\. Both the "*" and "?" wildcards (see below) can be used within a field name; however, they cannot be the first character of the field name\.
.
.SS "EXACT MATCHES"
Without any search modifiers, a search returns those fields for which the \fBsearch_pattern\fR exactly matches the value of \fBfield\fR in the JSON description of the object\.
.
.SS "WILDCARD MATCHES"
Search support both single\- and multi\-character wildcard searches within a search pattern\.
.
.P
\'?\' matches exactly one character\.
.
.P
\'*\' matches zero or more characters\.
.
.SS "RANGE MATCHES"
Range searches allows one to match values between two given values\. To match values between X and Y, inclusively, use square brackets:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

knife search INDEX \'field:[X TO Y]
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
To match values between X and Y, exclusively, use curly brackets:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

knife search INDEX \'field:{X TO Y}\'
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
Values are sorted in lexicographic order\.
.
.SS "FUZZY MATCHES"
Fuzzy searches allows one to match values based on the Levenshtein Distance algorithm\. To perform a fuzzy match, append a tilda (~) to the search term:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

knife search INDEX \'field:term~\'
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
This search would return nodes whose \fBfield\fR was \'perm\' or \'germ\'\.
.
.SS "BOOLEAN OPERATORS"
The boolean operators NOT, AND, and OR are supported\. To find values of \fBfield\fR that are not X:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

knife search INDEX \'field:(NOT X)\'
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
To find records where \fBfield1\fR is X and \fBfield2\fR is Y:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

knife search INDEX \'field1:X AND field2:Y\'
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
To find records where \fBfield\fR is X or Y:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

knife search INDEX \'field:X OR field:Y\'
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.SS "QUOTING AND SPECIAL CHARACTERS"
In order to avoid having special characters and escape sequences within your search term interpreted by either Ruby or the shell, enclose them in single quotes\.
.
.P
Search terms that include spaces should be enclosed in double\-quotes:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

knife search INDEX \'field:"term with spaces"\'
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
The following characters must be escaped:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

+ \- && || ! ( ) { } [ ] ^ " ~ * ? : \e
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
Find the nodes with the fully\-qualified domain name (FQDN) www\.example\.com:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

knife search node \'fqdn:www\.example\.com\'
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
Find the nodes running a version of Ubuntu:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

knife search node \'platform:ubuntu*\'
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.P
Find all nodes running CentOS in the production environment:
.
.IP "" 4
.
.nf

knife search node \'chef_environment:production AND platform:centos\'
.
.fi
.
.IP "" 0
.
.SH "KNOWN BUGS"
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Searches against the client index return no results in most cases\. (CHEF\-2477)
.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Searches using the fuzzy match operator (~) produce an error\. (CHEF\-2478)
