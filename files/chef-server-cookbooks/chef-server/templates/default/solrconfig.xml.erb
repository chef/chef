    An analysis handler that provides a breakdown of the analysis process of provided docuemnts. This handler expects a

    sending either an "analysis.query" or "q" request paraemter that holds the query text to be analyized. It also
    supports the "analysis.showmatch" parameter which when set to true, all field tokens that match the query
