      # Deep Merge core documentation.
      # deep_merge! method permits merging of arbitrary child elements. The two top level
      # elements must be hashes. These hashes can contain unlimited (to stack limit) levels
      # of child elements. These child elements to not have to be of the same types.
      # Where child elements are of the same type, deep_merge will attempt to merge them together.
      # Where child elements are not of the same type, deep_merge will skip or optionally overwrite
      # the destination element with the contents of the source element at that level.
      # So if you have two hashes like this:
      #   source = {:x => [1,2,3], :y => 2}
      #   dest =   {:x => [4,5,'6'], :y => [7,8,9]}
      #   dest.deep_merge!(source)
      #   Results: {:x => [1,2,3,4,5,'6'], :y => 2}
      # By default, "deep_merge!" will overwrite any unmergeables and merge everything else.
      # To avoid this, use "deep_merge" (no bang/exclamation mark)
