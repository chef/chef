## DESCRIPTION

The Chef Client is where almost all of the work in Chef is done. It
communicates with the Chef Server via REST, authenticates via Signed
Header Authentication, and compiles and executes Cookbooks.

A Chef Client does work on behalf of a Node. A single Chef Client can
run recipes for multiple Nodes.

Clients are where all the action happens - the Chef Server and Chef Expander
are largely services that exist only to provide the Client with information.
