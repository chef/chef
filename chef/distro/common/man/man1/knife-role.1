.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Roles provide a mechanism to group repeated configuration settings\. Roles are data structures that contain \fBdefault_attributes\fR, and \fBoverride_attributes\fR, which are nested hashes of configuration settings, and a \fBrun_list\fR, which is an ordered list of recipes and roles that should be applied to a host by chef\-client\.
.
.P
\fBdefault_attributes\fR will be overridden if they conflict with a value on a node that includes the role\. Conversely, \fBoverride_attributes\fR will override any values set on nodes that apply them\.
.
.P
When \fBchef\-client\fR(8) configures a host, it will "expand" the \fBrun_list\fR included in that host\'s node data\. The expansion process will recursively replace any roles in the run_list with that role\'s run_list\.
