The \fIssh\fR sub\-command opens an ssh session to each of the nodes in the search results of the \fIQUERY\fR\. This sub\-command requires that the net\-ssh\-multi and highline Ruby libraries are installed\. On Debian systems, these are the libnet\-ssh\-multi\-ruby and libhighline\-ruby packages\. They can also be installed as RubyGems (net\-ssh\-multi and highline, respectively)\.
