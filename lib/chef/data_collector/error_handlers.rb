  class DataCollector

    # This module isolates the handling of collecting error descriptions to insert into the data_collector
    # report output.  For very early errors it is responsible for collecting the node_name for the report
    # to use.  For all failure conditions that have an ErrorMapper it collects the output.
    #
    # No external code should call anything in this module directly.
