class Chef
  # == Chef::CookbookCollection
  # This class is the consistent interface for a node to obtain its
  # cookbooks by name.
  #
  # This class is basically a glorified Hash, but since there are
  # several ways this cookbook information is collected,
  # (e.g. CookbookLoader for solo, hash of auto-vivified Cookbook
  # objects for lazily-loaded remote cookbooks), it gets transformed
  # into this.
  class CookbookCollection < Mash

    # The input is a mapping of cookbook name to CookbookVersion objects. We
    # simply extract them

    # against the running Chef::VERSION and Ohai::VERSION.
