    # This FileVendor loads files from Chef::Config.cookbook_path. The
    # thing that's sort of janky about this FileVendor implementation is
    # that it basically takes only the cookbook's name from the manifest
    # and throws the rest away then re-builds the list of files on the
    # disk. This is due to the manifest not having the on-disk file
    # locations, since in the chef-client case, that information is
    # non-sensical.
