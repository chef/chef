class Chef
  class Decorator
    # Lazy Array around Lazy Objects
    #
    # This makes access lazy through `#[]`.  In order to implement #each we need to
    # know how many items we have and what their indexes are, so we'd have to evaluate
    # the proc which makes that impossible.  You can call methods like #each and the
    # decorator will forward the method, but item access will not be lazy.
    #
    # #at() and #fetch() are not implemented but technically could be.
    #
    # @example
    #     def foo
    #         puts "allocated"
    #           "value"
    #     end
    #
    #     a = Chef::Decorator::LazyArray.new { [ foo ] }
    #
    #     puts "started"
    #     a[0]
    #     puts "still lazy"
    #     puts a[0]
    #
    #   outputs:
    #
    #     started
    #     still lazy
    #     allocated
    #     value
    #
