      # See RFC 027 for a full specification
      #
      # File verifications allow user-supplied commands a means of
      # preventing file resource content deploys.  Their intended use
      # is to verify the contents of a temporary file before it is
      # deployed onto the system.
      #
      # Similar to not_if and only_if, file verifications can take a
      # ruby block, which will be called, or a string, which will be
      # executed as a Shell command.
      #
      # Additonally, Chef or third-party verifications can ship
      # "registered verifications" that the user can use by specifying
      # a :symbol as the command name.
      #
      # To create a registered verification, create a class that
      # inherits from Chef::Resource::File::Verification and use the
      # provides class method to give it name.  Registered
      # verifications are expected to supply a verify instance method
      # that takes 2 arguments.
      #
      # Example:
      # class Chef
      #  class Resource
      #    class File::Verification::Foo < Chef::Resource::File::Verification
      #      provides :noop
      #      def verify(path, opts)
      #        #yolo
      #        true
      #      end
      #    end
      #  end
