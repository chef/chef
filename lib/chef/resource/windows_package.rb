      description <<~DESC
        Use the **windows_package** resource to manage packages on the Microsoft Windows platform.
        The **windows_package** resource supports these installer formats:
          * Microsoft Installer Package (MSI)
          * Nullsoft Scriptable Install System (NSIS)
          * Inno Setup (inno)
          * Wise
          * InstallShield
          * Custom installers such as installing a non-.msi file that embeds an .msi-based installer

        To enable idempotence of the `:install` action or to enable the `:remove` action with no source property specified,
        `package_name` MUST be an exact match of the name used by the package installer. The names of installed packages
        Windows knows about can be found in **Add/Remove programs**, in the output of `ohai packages`, or in the
        `DisplayName` property in one of the following in the Windows registry:

        * `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall`
        * `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall`
        * `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Wow6432Node\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Uninstall`

        Note: If there are multiple versions of a package installed with the same display name, all of those packages will
        be removed unless a version is provided in the **version** property or unless it can be discovered in the installer
        file specified by the **source** property.

      examples <<~DOC
      **Install a package**:

      ```ruby
      windows_package '7zip' do
        action :install
        source 'C:\\7z920.msi'
      end
      ```

      **Specify a URL for the source attribute**:

      ```ruby
      windows_package '7zip' do
        source 'http://www.7-zip.org/a/7z938-x64.msi'
      end
      ```

      **Specify path and checksum**:

      ```ruby
      windows_package '7zip' do
        source 'http://www.7-zip.org/a/7z938-x64.msi'
        checksum '7c8e873991c82ad9cfc123415254ea6101e9a645e12977dcd518979e50fdedf3'
      end
      ```

      **Modify remote_file resource attributes**:

      The windows_package resource may specify a package at a remote location using the remote_file_attributes property. This uses the remote_file resource to download the contents at the specified URL and passes in a Hash that modifies the properties of the remote_file resource.

      ```ruby
      windows_package '7zip' do
        source 'http://www.7-zip.org/a/7z938-x64.msi'
        remote_file_attributes ({
          :path => 'C:\\7zip.msi',
          :checksum => '7c8e873991c82ad9cfc123415254ea6101e9a645e12977dcd518979e50fdedf3'
        })
      end
      ```

      **Download a nsis (Nullsoft) package resource**:

      ```ruby
      windows_package 'Mercurial 3.6.1 (64-bit)' do
        source 'http://mercurial.selenic.com/release/windows/Mercurial-3.6.1-x64.exe'
        checksum 'febd29578cb6736163d232708b834a2ddd119aa40abc536b2c313fc5e1b5831d'
      end
      ```

      **Download a custom package**:

      ```ruby
      windows_package 'Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Redistributable' do
        source 'https://download.microsoft.com/download/6/B/B/6BB661D6-A8AE-4819-B79F-236472F6070C/vcredist_x86.exe'
        installer_type :custom
        options '/Q'
