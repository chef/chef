      The **bff_package** resource is the default package provider on the AIX platform. The base **package** resource may be used, and then when the platform is AIX, #{ChefUtils::Dist::Infra::PRODUCT} will identify the correct package provider. The following examples show how to install part of the IBM XL C/C++ compiler.

      **Installing using the base package resource**

      ```ruby
      package 'xlccmp.13.1.0' do
        source '/var/tmp/IBM_XL_C_13.1.0/usr/sys/inst.images/xlccmp.13.1.0'
        action :install
      end
      ```

      **Installing using the bff_package resource**

      ```ruby
      bff_package 'xlccmp.13.1.0' do
        source '/var/tmp/IBM_XL_C_13.1.0/usr/sys/inst.images/xlccmp.13.1.0'
        action :install
      end
      ```
