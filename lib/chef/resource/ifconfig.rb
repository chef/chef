      description "Use the **ifconfig** resource to manage interfaces on Unix and Linux systems. Note: This resource requires the ifconfig binary to be present on the system and may require additional packages to be installed first. On Ubuntu 18.04 or later you will need to install the `ifupdown` package, which disables the built in Netplan functionality. Warning: This resource will not work with Fedora release 33 or later."

      **Configure a network interface with a static IP**

      ```ruby
      ifconfig '33.33.33.80' do
        device 'eth1'
      end
      ```

      will create the following interface configuration:

      ```
      iface eth1 inet static
        address 33.33.33.80
      ```

      **Configure an interface to use DHCP**

      ```ruby
      ifconfig 'Set eth1 to DHCP' do
        device 'eth1'
        bootproto 'dhcp'
      end
      ```

      will create the following interface configuration:

      ```
      iface eth1 inet dhcp
      ```

      **Update a static IP address with a boot protocol**

      ```ruby
      ifconfig "33.33.33.80" do
        bootproto "dhcp"
        device "eth1"
      end
      ```

      will update the interface configuration from static to dhcp:

      ```
      iface eth1 inet dhcp
        address 33.33.33.80
      ```
