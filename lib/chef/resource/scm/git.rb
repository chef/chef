      examples <<~DOC
      **Use the git mirror**

      ```ruby
      git '/opt/my_sources/couch' do
        repository 'git://git.apache.org/couchdb.git'
        revision 'master'
        action :sync
      end
      ```

      **Use different branches**

      To use different branches, depending on the environment of the node:

      ```ruby
      branch_name = if node.chef_environment == 'QA'
                      'staging'
                    else
                      'master'
                    end

      git '/home/user/deployment' do
         repository 'git@github.com:git_site/deployment.git'
         revision branch_name
         action :sync
         user 'user'
         group 'test'
      end
      ```

      Where the `branch_name` variable is set to staging or master, depending on the environment of the node. Once this is determined, the `branch_name` variable is used to set the revision for the repository. If the git status command is used after running the example above, it will return the branch name as `deploy`, as this is the default value. Run Chef Infra Client in debug mode to verify that the correct branches are being checked out:

      ```
      sudo chef-client -l debug
      ```

      **Install an application from git using bash**

      The following example shows how Bash can be used to install a plug-in for rbenv named ruby-build, which is located in git version source control. First, the application is synchronized, and then Bash changes its working directory to the location in which ruby-build is located, and then runs a command.

      ```ruby
      git "#{Chef::Config[:file_cache_path]}/ruby-build" do
        repository 'git://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build.git'
        revision 'master'
        action :sync
      end

      bash 'install_ruby_build' do
        cwd "#{Chef::Config[:file_cache_path]}/ruby-build"
        user 'rbenv'
        group 'rbenv'
        code <<-EOH
          ./install.sh
          EOH
        environment 'PREFIX' => '/usr/local'
      end
      ```

      **Notify a resource post-checkout**

      ```ruby
      git "#{Chef::Config[:file_cache_path]}/my_app" do
        repository node['my_app']['git_repository']
        revision node['my_app']['git_revision']
        action :sync
        notifies :run, 'bash[compile_my_app]', :immediately
      end
      ```

      **Pass in environment variables**

      ```ruby
      git '/opt/my_sources/couch' do
        repository 'git://git.apache.org/couchdb.git'
        revision 'master'
        environment 'VAR' => 'whatever'
        action :sync
      end
      ```
