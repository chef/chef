      provides :execute, target_mode: true

      description "Use the **execute** resource to execute a single command. Commands that are executed with this resource are (by their nature) not idempotent, as they are typically unique to the environment in which they are run. Use not_if and only_if to guard this resource for idempotence. Note: Use the **script** resource to execute a script using a specific interpreter (Ruby, Python, Perl, csh, or Bash)."

      examples <<~EXAMPLES
        **Run a command upon notification**:

        ```ruby
        execute 'slapadd' do
          command 'slapadd < /tmp/something.ldif'
          creates '/var/lib/slapd/uid.bdb'

          action :nothing
        end

        template '/tmp/something.ldif' do
          source 'something.ldif'

          notifies :run, 'execute[slapadd]', :immediately
        end
        ```

        **Run a touch file only once while running a command**:

        ```ruby
        execute 'upgrade script' do
          command 'php upgrade-application.php && touch /var/application/.upgraded'

          creates '/var/application/.upgraded'
          action :run
        end
        ```

        **Run a command which requires an environment variable**:

        ```ruby
        execute 'slapadd' do
          command 'slapadd < /tmp/something.ldif'
          creates '/var/lib/slapd/uid.bdb'

          action :run
          environment ({'HOME' => '/home/my_home'})
        end
        ```

        **Delete a repository using yum to scrub the cache**:

        ```ruby
        # the following code sample thanks to gaffneyc @ https://gist.github.com/918711
        execute 'clean-yum-cache' do
          command 'yum clean all'
          action :nothing
        end

        file '/etc/yum.repos.d/bad.repo' do
          action :delete
          notifies :run, 'execute[clean-yum-cache]', :immediately
        end
        ```

        **Prevent restart and reconfigure if configuration is broken**:

        Use the `:nothing` action (common to all resources) to prevent the test from
        starting automatically, and then use the `subscribes` notification to run a
        configuration test when a change to the template is detected.

        ```ruby
        execute 'test-nagios-config' do
          command 'nagios3 --verify-config'
          action :nothing
          subscribes :run, 'template[/etc/nagios3/configures-nagios.conf]', :immediately
        end
        ```

        **Notify in a specific order**:

        To notify multiple resources, and then have these resources run in a certain
        order, do something like the following.

        ```ruby
        execute 'foo' do
          command '...'
          notifies :create, 'template[baz]', :immediately
          notifies :install, 'package[bar]', :immediately
          notifies :run, 'execute[final]', :immediately
        end

        template 'baz' do
          #...
          notifies :run, 'execute[restart_baz]', :immediately
        end

        package 'bar'
          execute 'restart_baz'
          execute 'final' do
          command '...'
        end
        ```

        where the sequencing will be in the same order as the resources are listed in
        the recipe: `execute 'foo'`, `template 'baz'`, `execute [restart_baz]`,
        `package 'bar'`, and `execute 'final'`.

        **Execute a command using a template**:

        The following example shows how to set up IPv4 packet forwarding using the
        **execute** resource to run a command named `forward_ipv4` that uses a template
        defined by the **template** resource.

        ```ruby
        execute 'forward_ipv4' do
          command 'echo > /proc/.../ipv4/ip_forward'
          action :nothing
        end

        template '/etc/file_name.conf' do
          source 'routing/file_name.conf.erb'

         notifies :run, 'execute[forward_ipv4]', :delayed
        end
        ```

        where the `command` property for the **execute** resource contains the command
        that is to be run and the `source` property for the **template** resource
        specifies which template to use. The `notifies` property for the **template**
        specifies that the `execute[forward_ipv4]` (which is defined by the **execute**
        resource) should be queued up and run at the end of a Chef Infra Client run.

        **Add a rule to an IP table**:

        The following example shows how to add a rule named `test_rule` to an IP table
        using the **execute** resource to run a command using a template that is defined
        by the **template** resource:

        ```ruby
        execute 'test_rule' do
          command "command_to_run
            --option value
            --option value
            --source \#{node[:name_of_node][:ipsec][:local][:subnet]}
            -j test_rule"

          action :nothing
        end

        template '/etc/file_name.local' do
          source 'routing/file_name.local.erb'
          notifies :run, 'execute[test_rule]', :delayed
        end
        ```

        where the `command` property for the **execute** resource contains the command
        that is to be run and the `source` property for the **template** resource
        specifies which template to use. The `notifies` property for the **template**
        specifies that the `execute[test_rule]` (which is defined by the **execute**
        resource) should be queued up and run at the end of a Chef Infra Client run.

        **Stop a service, do stuff, and then restart it**:

        The following example shows how to use the **execute**, **service**, and
        **mount** resources together to ensure that a node running on Amazon EC2 is
        running MySQL. This example does the following:

        - Checks to see if the Amazon EC2 node has MySQL
        - If the node has MySQL, stops MySQL
        - Installs MySQL
        - Mounts the node
        - Restarts MySQL

        ```ruby
        # the following code sample comes from the ``server_ec2``
        # recipe in the following cookbook:
        # https://github.com/chef-cookbooks/mysql

        if (node.attribute?('ec2') && !FileTest.directory?(node['mysql']['ec2_path']))
          service 'mysql' do
            action :stop
          end

          execute 'install-mysql' do
            command "mv \#{node['mysql']['data_dir']} \#{node['mysql']['ec2_path']}"
            not_if { ::File.directory?(node['mysql']['ec2_path']) }
          end

          [node['mysql']['ec2_path'], node['mysql']['data_dir']].each do |dir|
            directory dir do
              owner 'mysql'
              group 'mysql'
            end
          end

          mount node['mysql']['data_dir'] do
            device node['mysql']['ec2_path']
            fstype 'none'
            options 'bind,rw'
            action [:mount, :enable]
          end

          service 'mysql' do
            action :start
          end
        end
        ```

        where

        - the two **service** resources are used to stop, and then restart the MySQL service
        - the **execute** resource is used to install MySQL
        - the **mount** resource is used to mount the node and enable MySQL

        **Use the platform_family? method**:

        The following is an example of using the `platform_family?` method in the Recipe
        DSL to create a variable that can be used with other resources in the same
        recipe. In this example, `platform_family?` is being used to ensure that a
        specific binary is used for a specific platform before using the **remote_file**
        resource to download a file from a remote location, and then using the
        **execute** resource to install that file by running a command.

        ```ruby
        if platform_family?('rhel')
          pip_binary = '/usr/bin/pip'
        else
          pip_binary = '/usr/local/bin/pip'
        end

        remote_file "\#{Chef::Config[:file_cache_path]}/distribute_setup.py" do
          source 'http://python-distribute.org/distribute_setup.py'
          mode '0755'
          not_if { ::File.exist?(pip_binary) }
        end

        execute 'install-pip' do
          cwd Chef::Config[:file_cache_path]
          command <<~EOF
            # command for installing Python goes here
          EOF
          not_if { ::File.exist?(pip_binary) }
        end
        ```

        where a command for installing Python might look something like:

        ```ruby
        \#{node['python']['binary']} distribute_setup.py \#{::File.dirname(pip_binary)}/easy_install pip
        ```

        **Control a service using the execute resource**:

        <div class="admonition-warning">
          <p class="admonition-warning-title">Warning</p>
          <div class="admonition-warning-text">
            This is an example of something that should NOT be done. Use the **service**
            resource to control a service, not the **execute** resource.
          </div>
        </div>

        Do something like this:

        ```ruby
        service 'tomcat' do
          action :start
        end
        ```

        and NOT something like this:

        ```ruby
        execute 'start-tomcat' do
          command '/etc/init.d/tomcat start'
          action :run
        end
        ```

        There is no reason to use the **execute** resource to control a service because
        the **service** resource exposes the `start_command` property directly, which
        gives a recipe full control over the command issued in a much cleaner, more
        direct manner.

        **Use the search recipe DSL method to find users**:

        The following example shows how to use the `search` method in the Recipe DSL to
        search for users:

        ```ruby
        #  the following code sample comes from the openvpn cookbook:

        search("users", "*:*") do |u|
          execute "generate-openvpn-\#{u['id']}" do
            command "./pkitool \#{u['id']}"
            cwd '/etc/openvpn/easy-rsa'
          end

          %w{ conf ovpn }.each do |ext|
            template "\#{node['openvpn']['key_dir']}/\#{u['id']}.\#{ext}" do
              source 'client.conf.erb'
              variables :username => u['id']
            end
          end
        end
        ```

        where

        - the search data will be used to create **execute** resources
        - the **template** resource tells Chef Infra Client which template to use

        **Enable remote login for macOS**:

        ```ruby
        execute 'enable ssh' do
          command '/usr/sbin/systemsetup -setremotelogin on'
          not_if '/usr/sbin/systemsetup -getremotelogin | /usr/bin/grep On'
          action :run
        end
        ```

        **Execute code immediately, based on the template resource**:

        By default, notifications are `:delayed`, that is they are queued up as they are
        triggered, and then executed at the very end of a Chef Infra Client run. To run
        kan action immediately, use `:immediately`:

        ```ruby
        template '/etc/nagios3/configures-nagios.conf' do
          # other parameters
          notifies :run, 'execute[test-nagios-config]', :immediately
        end
        ```

        and then Chef Infra Client would immediately run the following:

        ```ruby
        execute 'test-nagios-config' do
          command 'nagios3 --verify-config'
          action :nothing
        end
        ```

        **Sourcing a file**:

        The **execute** resource cannot be used to source a file (e.g. `command 'source
        filename'`). The following example will fail because `source` is not an
        executable:

        ```ruby
        execute 'foo' do
          command 'source /tmp/foo.sh'
        end
        ```


        Instead, use the **script** resource or one of the **script**-based resources
        (**bash**, **csh**, **perl**, **python**, or **ruby**). For example:

        ```ruby
        bash 'foo' do
          code 'source /tmp/foo.sh'
        end
        ```

        **Run a Knife command**:

        ```ruby
        execute 'create_user' do
          command <<~EOM
            knife user create \#{user}
              --admin
              --password password
              --disable-editing
              --file /home/vagrant/.chef/user.pem
              --config /tmp/knife-admin.rb
            EOM
        end
        ```

        **Run install command into virtual environment**:

        The following example shows how to install a lightweight JavaScript framework
        into Vagrant:

        ```ruby
        execute "install q and zombiejs" do
          cwd "/home/vagrant"
          user "vagrant"
          environment ({'HOME' => '/home/vagrant', 'USER' => 'vagrant'})
          command "npm install -g q zombie should mocha coffee-script"
          action :run
        end
        ```

        **Run a command as a named user**:

        The following example shows how to run `bundle install` from a Chef Infra Client
        run as a specific user. This will put the gem into the path of the user
        (`vagrant`) instead of the root user (under which the Chef Infra Client runs):

        ```ruby
        execute '/opt/chefdk/embedded/bin/bundle install' do
          cwd node['chef_workstation']['bundler_path']
          user node['chef_workstation']['user']

          environment ({
            'HOME' => "/home/\#{node['chef_workstation']['user']}",
            'USER' => node['chef_workstation']['user']
          })
          not_if 'bundle check'
        end
        ```

        **Run a command as an alternate user**:

        *Note*: When Chef is running as a service, this feature requires that the user
        that Chef runs as has 'SeAssignPrimaryTokenPrivilege' (aka
        'SE_ASSIGNPRIMARYTOKEN_NAME') user right. By default only LocalSystem and
        NetworkService have this right when running as a service. This is necessary
        even if the user is an Administrator.

        This right can be added and checked in a recipe using this example:

        ```ruby
        # Add 'SeAssignPrimaryTokenPrivilege' for the user
        Chef::ReservedNames::Win32::Security.add_account_right('<user>', 'SeAssignPrimaryTokenPrivilege')

        # Check if the user has 'SeAssignPrimaryTokenPrivilege' rights
        Chef::ReservedNames::Win32::Security.get_account_right('<user>').include?('SeAssignPrimaryTokenPrivilege')
        ```

        The following example shows how to run `mkdir test_dir` from a Chef Infra Client
        run as an alternate user.

        ```ruby
        # Passing only username and password
        execute 'mkdir test_dir' do
          cwd Chef::Config[:file_cache_path]

          user "username"
          password "password"
        end

        # Passing username and domain
        execute 'mkdir test_dir' do
          cwd Chef::Config[:file_cache_path]

          domain "domain-name"
          user "user"
          password "password"
        end

        # Passing username = 'domain-name\\username'. No domain is passed
        execute 'mkdir test_dir' do
          cwd Chef::Config[:file_cache_path]

          user "domain-name\\username"
          password "password"
        end

        # Passing username = 'username@domain-name'.  No domain is passed
        execute 'mkdir test_dir' do
          cwd Chef::Config[:file_cache_path]

          user "username@domain-name"
          password "password"
        end
        ```

        **Run a command with an external input file**:

        execute 'md5sum' do
          input File.read(__FILE__)
        end
