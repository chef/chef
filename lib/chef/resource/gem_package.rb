      description <<~DESC
        Use the **gem_package** resource to manage gem packages that are only included in recipes.
        When a gem is installed from a local file, it must be added to the node using the **remote_file** or **cookbook_file** resources.

        Note: The **gem_package** resource must be specified as `gem_package` and cannot be shortened to `package` in a recipe.

        Warning: The **chef_gem** and **gem_package** resources are both used to install Ruby gems. For any machine on which #{ChefUtils::Dist::Infra::PRODUCT} is
        installed, there are two instances of Ruby. One is the standard, system-wide instance of Ruby and the other is a dedicated instance that is
        available only to #{ChefUtils::Dist::Infra::PRODUCT}.
        Use the **chef_gem** resource to install gems into the instance of Ruby that is dedicated to #{ChefUtils::Dist::Infra::PRODUCT}.
        Use the **gem_package** resource to install all other gems (i.e. install gems system-wide).
      DESC

      examples <<~EXAMPLES
        The following examples demonstrate various approaches for using the **gem_package** resource in recipes:

        **Install a gem file from the local file system**

        ```ruby
        gem_package 'loofah' do
          source '/tmp/loofah-2.7.0.gem'
          action :install
        end
        ```

        **Use the `ignore_failure` common attribute**

        ```ruby
        gem_package 'syntax' do
          action :install
          ignore_failure true
        end
        ```
