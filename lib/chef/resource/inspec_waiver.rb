      description "Use the **inspec_waiver** resource to add a waiver to the Compliance Phase."
      introduced "17.5"
      examples <<~DOC
      **Activate the default waiver in the openssh cookbook's compliance segment**:

      ```ruby
        inspec_waiver 'openssh' do
          action :add
        end
      ```

      **Activate all waivers in the openssh cookbook's compliance segment**:

      ```ruby
        inspec_waiver 'openssh::.*' do
          action :add
        end
      ```

      **Add an InSpec waiver to the Compliance Phase**:

      ```ruby
        inspec_waiver 'Add waiver entry for control' do
          control 'my_inspec_control_01'
          run_test false
          justification "The subject of this control is not managed by #{ChefUtils::Dist::Infra::PRODUCT} on the systems in policy group \#{node['policy_group']}"
          expiration '2022-01-01'
          action :add
        end
      ```

      **Add an InSpec waiver to the Compliance Phase using the 'name' property to identify the control**:

      ```ruby
        inspec_waiver 'my_inspec_control_01' do
          justification "The subject of this control is not managed by #{ChefUtils::Dist::Infra::PRODUCT} on the systems in policy group \#{node['policy_group']}"
          action :add
        end
      ```

      **Add an InSpec waiver to the Compliance Phase using an arbitrary YAML, JSON, or TOML file**:

      ```ruby
        # files ending in .yml or .yaml that exist are parsed as YAML
        inspec_waiver "/path/to/my/waiver.yml"

        inspec_waiver "my-waiver-name" do
          source "/path/to/my/waiver.yml"
        end

        # files ending in .json that exist are parsed as JSON
        inspec_waiver "/path/to/my/waiver.json"

        inspec_waiver "my-waiver-name" do
          source "/path/to/my/waiver.json"
        end

        # files ending in .toml that exist are parsed as TOML
        inspec_waiver "/path/to/my/waiver.toml"

        inspec_waiver "my-waiver-name" do
          source "/path/to/my/waiver.toml"
        end
      ```

      **Add an InSpec waiver to the Compliance Phase using a hash**:

      ```ruby
        my_hash = { "ssh-01" => {
          "expiration_date" => "2033-07-31",
          "run" => false,
          "justification" => "because"
        } }

        inspec_waiver "my-waiver-name" do
          source my_hash
        end
      ```

      Note that the **inspec_waiver** resource does not update and will not fire notifications (similar to the log resource). This is done to preserve the ability to use
      the resource while not causing the updated resource count to be larger than zero. Since the resource does not update the state of the managed node, this behavior
      is still consistent with the configuration management model. Instead, you should use events to observe configuration changes for the compliance phase. It is
      possible to use the `notify_group` resource to chain notifications of the two resources, but notifications are the wrong model to use, and you should use pure ruby
      conditionals instead. Compliance configuration should be independent of other resources and should only be conditional based on state/attributes, not other resources.
