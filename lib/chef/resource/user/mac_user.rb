class Chef
  class Resource
    class User
      # Provide a user resource that is compatible with default TCC restrictions
      # that were introduced in macOS 10.14.
      #
      # Changes:
      #
      # * This resource and the corresponding provider have been modified to
      #   work with default macOS TCC policies. Direct access to user binary
      #   plists are no longer permitted by default, thus we've chosen to use
      #   a combination of newer utilities for managing user lifecycles and older
      #   utilities for managing passwords.
      #
      # * Due to tooling changes that were necessitated by the new policy
      #   restrictions the mac_user resource is only suitable for use on macOS
      #   >= 10.14. Support for older platforms has been removed.
      #
      # New Features:
      #
      # * Primary group management is now included.
      #
      # * 'admin' is now a boolean property that configures a user to an admin.
      #
      # * 'admin_username' and 'admin_password' are new properties that define the
      #   admin user credentials required for toggling SecureToken for a user.
      #
      #   The value of 'admin_username' must correspond to a system user that
      #   is part of the 'admin' with SecureToken enabled in order to toggle
      #   SecureToken.
      #
      # * 'secure_token' is a boolean property that sets the desired state
      #   for SecureToken. SecureToken token is required for FileVault full
      #   disk encryption.
      #
      # * 'secure_token_password' is the plaintext password required to enable
      #   or disable secure_token for a user. If no salt is specified we assume
      #   the 'password' property corresponds to a plaintext password and will
      #   attempt to use it in place of secure_token_password if it not set.
