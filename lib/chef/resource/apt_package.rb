      **Install a package using package manager**:

      ```ruby
      apt_package 'name of package' do
        action :install
      end
      ```

      **Install a package without specifying the default action**:

      ```ruby
      apt_package 'name of package'
      ```

      **Install multiple packages at once**:

      ```ruby
      apt_package %w(package1 package2 package3)
      ```

      **Install without using recommend packages as a dependency**:

      ```ruby
      package 'apache2' do
        options '--no-install-recommends'
      end
      ```

      **Prevent the apt_package resource from installing packages with pattern matching names**:

      By default, the apt_package resource will install the named package.
      If it can't find a package with the exact same name, it will treat the package name as regular expression string and match with any package that matches that regular expression.
      This may lead Chef Infra Client to install one or more packages with names that match that regular expression.

      In this example, `anchor_package_regex true` prevents the apt_package resource from installing matching packages if it can't find the `lua5.3` package.

      ```ruby
      apt_package 'lua5.3' do
        version '5.3.3-1.1ubuntu2'
        anchor_package_regex true
      end
      ```
