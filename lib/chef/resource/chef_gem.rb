class Chef
  class Resource
    # Use the chef_gem resource to install a gem only for the instance of Ruby that is dedicated to the chef-client.
    # When a gem is installed from a local file, it must be added to the node using the remote_file or cookbook_file
    # resources.
    #
    # The chef_gem resource works with all of the same properties and options as the gem_package resource, but does not
    # accept the gem_binary property because it always uses the CurrentGemEnvironment under which the chef-client is
    # running. In addition to performing actions similar to the gem_package resource, the chef_gem resource does the
    # following:
    #  - Runs its actions immediately, before convergence, allowing a gem to be used in a recipe immediately after it is
    #    installed
    #  - Runs Gem.clear_paths after the action, ensuring that gem is aware of changes so that it can be required
    #    immediately after it is installed
