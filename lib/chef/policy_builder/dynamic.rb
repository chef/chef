      ### Lifecycle Methods ###

      # @!method build_node
      #
      # Applies external attributes (e.g., from JSON file, environment,
      # policyfile, etc.) and determines the correct expanded run list for the
      # run.

      # @return [Chef::Node]

      #

      #
      # @return [#recipes, #roles] A RunListExpansion or duck-type.

      #

      #

      # to do the final node save at the end of the run or not.
