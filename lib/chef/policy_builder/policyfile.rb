    # Policyfile is an experimental policy builder implementation that gets run
    # list and cookbook version information from a single document.
    #
    # == WARNING
    # This implementation is experimental. It may be changed in incompatible
    # ways in minor or even patch releases, or even abandoned altogether. If
    # using this with other tools, you may be forced to upgrade those tools in
    # lockstep with chef-client because of incompatible behavior changes.
    #
    # == Unsupported Options:
    # * override_runlist:: This could potentially be integrated into the
    # policyfile, or replaced with a similar feature that has different
    # semantics.
    # * specific_recipes:: put more design thought into this use case.
    # * run_list in json_attribs:: would be ignored anyway, so it raises an error.
    # * chef-solo:: not currently supported. Need more design thought around
    # how this should work.
