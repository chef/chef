        # Override this if you have a special comparison algorithm that can tell
        # you whether this entry is the same as another--either a quicker or a
        # more reliable one.  Callers will use this to decide whether to upload,
        # download or diff an object.
        #
        # You should not override this if you're going to do the standard
        # +self.read == other.read+.  If you return +nil+, the caller will call
        # +other.compare_to(you)+ instead.  Give them a chance :)
        #
        # ==== Parameters
        #
        # * +other+ - the entry to compare to
        #
        # ==== Returns
        #
        # * +[ are_same, value, other_value ]+
        #   +are_same+ may be +true+, +false+ or +nil+ (which means "don't know").
        #   +value+ and +other_value+ must either be the text of +self+ or +other+,
        #   +:none+ (if the entry does not exist or has no value) or +nil+ if the
        #   value was not retrieved.
        # * +nil+ if a definitive answer cannot be had and nothing was retrieved.
        #
        # ==== Example
        #
        #     are_same, value, other_value = entry.compare_to(other)
        #     if are_same.nil?
        #       are_same, other_value, value = other.compare_to(entry)
        #     end
        #     if are_same.nil?
        #       value = entry.read if value.nil?
        #       other_value = entry.read if other_value.nil?
