      # multi-tenant and RBAC to the open source product. In practice, they
      # mean:
      #
      # * static: just static objects that are included in a traditional
      #   chef-repo, with no support for anything introduced in Chef 12 or
      #   later.
      # * everything: all of the objects supported by the open source Chef
      #   Server 11.x
      # * hosted_everything: (the name comes from Hosted Chef) supports
      #   everything in Chef Server 12 and later, including RBAC objects and
      #   Policyfile objects.
      #
      # The "static" and "everything" modes are used for backup and
      # upgrade/migration of older Chef Servers, so they should be considered
      # frozen in time.

      #
      # Create a new Config object which can produce a chef_fs and local_fs.
      #
      # ==== Arguments
      #
      # [chef_config]
      #   A hash that looks suspiciously like +Chef::Config+.  These hash keys
      #   include:
      #
      #   :chef_repo_path::
      #     The root where all local chef object data is stored.  Mirrors
      #     +Chef::Config.chef_repo_path+
      #   :cookbook_path, node_path, ...::
      #     Paths to cookbooks/, nodes/, data_bags/, etc.  Mirrors
      #     +Chef::Config.cookbook_path+, etc.  Defaults to
      #     +<chef_repo_path>/cookbooks+, etc.
      #   :repo_mode::
      #     The directory format on disk.  'everything', 'hosted_everything' and
      #     'static'.  Default: autodetected based on whether the URL has
      #     "/organizations/NAME."
      #   :versioned_cookbooks::
      #     If true, the repository contains cookbooks with versions in their
      #     name (apache2-1.0.0).  If false, the repository just has one version
      #     of each cookbook and the directory has the cookbook name (apache2).
      #     Default: +false+
      #   :chef_server_url::
      #     The URL to the Chef server, e.g. https://api.opscode.com/organizations/foo.
      #     Used as the server for the remote chef_fs, and to "guess" repo_mode
      #     if not specified.
      #   :node_name:: The username to authenticate to the Chef server with.
      #   :client_key:: The private key for the user for authentication
      #   :environment:: The environment in which you are presently working
      #   :repo_mode::
      #     The repository mode, :hosted_everything, :everything or :static.
      #     This determines the set of subdirectories the Chef server will offer
      #     up.
      #   :versioned_cookbooks:: Whether or not to include versions in cookbook names
      #
      # [cwd]
      #   The current working directory to base relative Chef paths from.
      #   Defaults to +Dir.pwd+.
      #
      # [options]
      #   A hash of other, not-suspiciously-like-chef-config options:
      #   :cookbook_version::
      #     When downloading cookbooks, download this cookbook version instead
      #     of the latest.
      #
      # [ui]
      #   The object to print output to, with "output", "warn" and "error"
      #   (looks a little like a Chef::Knife::UI object, obtainable from
      #   Chef::Knife.ui).
      #
      # ==== Example
      #
      #   require 'chef/chef_fs/config'
      #   config = Chef::ChefFS::Config.new
      #   config.chef_fs.child('cookbooks').children.each do |cookbook|
      #     puts "Cookbook on server: #{cookbook.name}"
      #   end
      #   config.local_fs.child('cookbooks').children.each do |cookbook|
      #     puts "Local cookbook: #{cookbook.name}"
      #   end
