      # A Chef-FS path is a path in a chef-repository that can be used to address
      # both files on a local file-system as well as objects on a chef server.
      # These paths are stricter than file-system paths allowed on various OSes.
      # Absolute Chef-FS paths begin with "/" (on windows, "\" is acceptable as well).
      # "/" is used as the path element separator (on windows, "\" is acceptable as well).
      # No directory/path element may contain a literal "\" character.  Any such characters
      # encountered are either dealt with as separators (on windows) or as escape
      # characters (on POSIX systems).  Relative Chef-FS paths may use ".." or "." but
      # may never use these to back-out of the root of a Chef-FS path.  Any such extraneous
      # ".."s are ignored.
      # Chef-FS paths are case sensitive (since the paths on the server are).
      # On OSes with case insensitive paths, you may be unable to locally deal with two
      # objects whose server paths only differ by case.  OTOH, the case of path segments
      # that are outside the Chef-FS root (such as when looking at a file-system absolute
      # path to discover the Chef-FS root path) are handled in accordance to the rules
      # of the local file-system and OS.
