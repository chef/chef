  # Provider Resolution
  # ===================
  #
  # Provider resolution is the process of taking a Resource object and an
  # action, and determining the Provider class that should be instantiated to
  # handle the action.
  #
  # If the resource has its `provider` set, that is used.
  #
  # Otherwise, we take the lists of Providers that have registered as
  # providing the DSL through `provides :dsl_name, <filters>` or
  # `Chef.set_resource_priority_array :dsl_name, <filters>`.  We filter each
  # list of Providers through:
  #
  # 1. The filters it was registered with (such as `os: 'linux'` or
  #    `platform_family: 'debian'`)
  # 2. `provides?(node, resource)`
  # 3. `supports?(resource, action)`
  #
  # Anything that passes the filter and returns `true` to provides and supports,
  # is considered a match.  The first matching Provider in the *most recently
  # registered list* is selected and returned.
  #
