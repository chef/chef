    # The DataCollector is mode-agnostic reporting tool which can be used with
    # server-based and solo-based clients.  It can report to a file, to an
    # authenticated Chef Automate reporting endpoint, or to a user-supplied
    # webhook.  It sends two messages:  one at the start of the run and one
    # at the end of the run.  Most early failures in the actual Chef::Client itself
    # are reported, but parsing of the client.rb must have succeeded and some code
    # in Chef::Application could throw so early as to prevent reporting.  If
    # exceptions are thrown both run-start and run-end messages are still sent in
    # pairs.
