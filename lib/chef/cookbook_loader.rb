class Chef
  # This class is used by knife, cheffs and legacy chef-solo modes.  It is not used by the server mode
  # of chef-client or zolo/zero modes.
  #
  # This class implements orchestration around producing a single cookbook_version for a cookbook or
  # loading a Mash of all cookbook_versions, using the cookbook_version_loader class, and doing
  # lazy-access and memoization to only load each cookbook once on demand.
  #
  # This implements a key-value style each which makes it appear to be a Hash of String => CookbookVersion
  # pairs where the String is the cookbook name.  The use of Enumerable combined with the Hash-style
  # each is likely not entirely sane.
  #
  # This object is also passed and injected into the CookbookCollection object where it is converted
  # to a Mash that looks almost exactly like the cookbook_by_name Mash in this object.
  #
  class CookbookLoader

    attr_reader :repo_paths
