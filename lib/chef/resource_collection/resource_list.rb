      # [File1, LWRP1, Service1, Service2, File2] # The LWRP inserts Service2 and @insert_after_idx=3.  The LWRP
      #     finishes executing
      # [File1, LWRP1, Service1, Service2, File2] # The iterator moves to Service1 since it is the next non-executed
      #     resource.  The execute_each_resource call below resets @insert_after_idx=2
      # If Service1 was another LWRP, it would insert its resources between Service1 and Service2.  The iterator keeps
      # track of executed resources and @insert_after_idx keeps track of where the next resource to insert should be.
