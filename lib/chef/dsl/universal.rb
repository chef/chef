class Chef
  module DSL
    # Part of a family of DSL mixins.
    #
    # Chef::DSL::Recipe mixes into Recipes and LWRP Providers.
    #   - this does not target core chef resources and providers.
    #   - this is restricted to recipe/resource/provider context where a resource collection exists.
    #   - cookbook authors should typically include modules into here.
    #
    # Chef::DSL::Core mixes into Recipes, LWRP Providers and Core Providers
    #   - this adds cores providers on top of the Recipe DSL.
    #   - this is restricted to recipe/resource/provider context where a resource collection exists.
    #   - core chef authors should typically include modules into here.
    #
    # Chef::DSL::Universal mixes into Recipes, LWRP Resources+Providers, Core Resources+Providers, and Attributes files.
    #   - this adds resources and attributes files.
    #   - do not add helpers which manipulate the resource collection.
    #   - this is for general-purpose stuff that is useful nearly everywhere.
    #   - it also pollutes the namespace of nearly every context, watch out.
