          The Chef Server you are using does not support the username field.
          This means it is an Open Source 11 Server.
          knife user show for Open Source 11 Server is being deprecated.
          Open Source 11 Server user commands now live under the knife osc_user namespace.
          For backwards compatibility, we will forward this request to knife osc_user show.
          If you are using an Open Source 11 Server, please use that command to avoid this warning.
          NOTE: Backwards compatibility for Open Source 11 Server in these commands will be removed
          in Chef 15 which will be released April 2019.
