The Chef Server you are using does not support the username field.
This means it is an Open Source 11 Server.
knife user show for Open Source 11 Server is deprecated.
Open Source 11 Server user commands now live under the knife osc_user namespace.
For backwards compatibility, we will forward this request to knife osc_user show.
If you are using an Open Source 11 Server, please use that command to avoid this warning.
