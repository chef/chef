        # other service providers are narrowly platform-specific with no
        # alternatives.

        # NOTE: if a system has (for example) chkconfig installed then we
        # should report that chkconfig is installed.  The fact that a system
        # may also have systemd installed does not mean that we do not
        # report that systemd is also installed.  This module is purely for
        # discovery of all the alternatives, handling the priority of the
        # different services is NOT a design concern of this module.
