# PURPOSE: This strategy preserves the inode, and will preserve modes + ownership
#          even if the user running chef cannot create that ownership (but has
#          rights to the file).  It is vulnerable to crashes in the middle of
#          writing the file which could result in corruption or zero-length files.
