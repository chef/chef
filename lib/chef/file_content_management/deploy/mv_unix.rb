      # PURPOSE: this strategy is atomic, and attempts to preserve file modes
      #
      # NOTE: there is no preserve flag to FileUtils.mv, and we want to preserve the dst file
      #       modes rather than the src file modes (preserve = true is what mv does already, we
      #       would like preserve = false which is tricky).
      #
      class MvUnix
        def create(file)
          # this is very simple, but it ensures that ownership and file modes take
          # good defaults, in particular mode needs to obey umask on create

          # we may be running as non-root in which case because we are doing an mv we cannot preserve
          # the file modes.  after the mv we have a different inode and if we don't have rights to
          # chown/chgrp on the inode then we can't fix the ownership.
          #
          # in the case where i'm running chef-solo on my homedir as myself and some root-shell
          # work has caused dotfiles of mine to change to root-owned, i'm fine with this not being
          # exceptional, and i think most use cases will consider this to not be exceptional, and
          # the right thing is to fix the ownership of the file to the user running the commmand
          # (which requires write perms to the directory, or mv will throw an exception)
