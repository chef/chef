    # == [DEPRECATED] Chef::Mixin::DeprecatedLanguageModule
    # This module is a temporary replacement for the previous
    # Chef::Mixin::Language. That module's functionality was split into two
    # modules, Chef::DSL::PlatformIntrospection, and Chef::DSL::DataQuery.
    #
    # This module includes both PlatformIntrospection and DataQuery to provide
    # the same interfaces and behavior as the prior Mixin::Language.
    #
    # This module is loaded via const_missing hook when Chef::Mixin::Language
    # is accessed. See chef/mixin/deprecation for details.

    deprecate_constant(:Language, DeprecatedLanguageModule, <<-EOM)
Chef::Mixin::Language is deprecated. Use either (or both)
Chef::DSL::PlatformIntrospection or Chef::DSL::DataQuery instead.
