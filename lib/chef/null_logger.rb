class Chef

  # Null logger implementation that just ignores everything. This is used by
  # classes that are intended to be reused outside of Chef, but need to offer
  # logging functionality when used by other Chef code.
  #
  # It does not define the full interface provided by Logger, just enough to be
  # a reasonable duck type. In particular, methods setting the log level, log
  # device, etc., are not implemented because any code calling those methods
  # probably expected a real logger and not this "fake" one.
