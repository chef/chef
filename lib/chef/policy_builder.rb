class Chef

  # PolicyBuilder contains classes that handles fetching policy from server or
  # disk and resolving any indirection (e.g. expanding run_list).
  #
  # INPUTS
  # * event stream object
  # * node object/run_list
  # * json_attribs
  # * override_runlist
  #
  # OUTPUTS
  # * mutated node object (implicit)
  # * a new RunStatus (probably doesn't need to be here)
  # * cookbooks sync'd to disk
  # * cookbook_hash is stored in run_context
