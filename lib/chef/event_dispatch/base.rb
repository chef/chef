class Chef

  # ==EventDispatch
  # Classes in EventDispatch deal with collecting, distributing, and handling
  # information in response to events that occur during a chef-client run.
  #
  # EventDispatch uses a simple publishing system where data from all events
  # are forwarded to all subscribers unconditionally.
  #
  # EventDispatch is used to implement custom console output formatters so that
  # users may have more control over the formatting and verbosity of Chef
  # client output and client-side data collection for server-side client
  # history storage and reporting.
  #
  # === API Stability Status
  # The EventDispatch API is intended to become a stable, public API upon which
  # end-users can implement their own custom output formatters, reporting
  # integration libraries, and more. This is a new feature, however, so
  # breaking changes may be required as it "bakes" in order to provide a clean,
  # coherent and supportable API in the long term. Therefore, developers should
  # consider the feature "beta" for now and be prepared for possible breaking
  # changes in point releases.
  module EventDispatch

    # == EventDispatch::Base
    # EventDispatch::Base is a completely abstract base class that defines the
    # API used by both the classes that collect event information and those
    # that process them.
