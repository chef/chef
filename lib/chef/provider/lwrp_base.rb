      # Enables inline evaluation of resources in provider actions.
      #
      # Without this option, any resources declared inside the LWRP are added
      # to the resource collection after the current position at the time the
      # action is executed. Because they are added to the primary resource
      # collection for the chef run, they can notify other resources outside
      # the LWRP, and potentially be notified by resources outside the LWRP
      # (but this is complicated by the fact that they don't exist until the
      # provider executes). In this mode, it is impossible to correctly set the
      # updated_by_last_action flag on the parent LWRP resource, since it
      # executes and returns before its component resources are run.
      #
      # With this option enabled, each action creates a temporary run_context
      # with its own resource collection, evaluates the action's code in that
      # context, and then converges the resources created. If any resources
      # were updated, then this provider's new_resource will be marked updated.
      #
      # In this mode, resources created within the LWRP cannot interact with
      # external resources via notifies, though notifications to other
      # resources within the LWRP will work. Delayed notifications are executed
      # at the conclusion of the provider's action, *not* at the end of the
      # main chef run.
      #
      # This mode of evaluation is experimental, but is believed to be a better
      # set of tradeoffs than the append-after mode, so it will likely become
      # the default in a future major release of Chef.
