Feature: Transfer Remote Files
  In order to easily manage many systems at once
  As a Developer
  I want to manage the contents of files remotely

  Scenario: Transfer a file from a cookbook
    Given a validated node
      And it includes the recipe 'transfer_remote_files::transfer_a_file_from_a_cookbook'
     When I run the chef-client
     Then the run should exit '0'
      And a file named 'transfer_a_file_from_a_cookbook.txt' should contain 'easy like sunday morning'

  Scenario: Scenario: Attempting to use a non-existent cookbook file causes an error
    Given a validated node
      And it includes the recipe 'transfer_remote_files::transfer_a_non-existent_file_from_a_cookbook'
     When I run the chef-client
     Then the run should exit '1'
      And 'stdout' should have 'cookbook transfer_remote_files does not contain file files/transfer_a_non-existent_file_from_a_cookbook.txt'

  Scenario: Should prefer the file for this specific host
    Given a validated node
      And it includes the recipe 'transfer_remote_files::should_prefer_the_file_for_this_specific_host'
      And the cookbook has a 'file' named 'host_specific.txt' in the 'host' specific directory
      And the cookbook has a 'file' named 'host_specific.txt' in the 'platform-version' specific directory
      And the cookbook has a 'file' named 'host_specific.txt' in the 'platform' specific directory
      And the cookbook has a 'file' named 'host_specific.txt' in the 'default' specific directory
      And I upload the cookbook
     When I run the chef-client
     Then the run should exit '0'
      And a file named 'host_specific.txt' should be from the 'host' specific directory

  Scenario: Should prefer the file for the correct platform version
    Given a validated node
      And it includes the recipe 'transfer_remote_files::should_prefer_the_file_for_this_specific_host'
      And the cookbook has a 'file' named 'host_specific.txt' in the 'platform-version' specific directory
      And the cookbook has a 'file' named 'host_specific.txt' in the 'platform' specific directory
      And the cookbook has a 'file' named 'host_specific.txt' in the 'default' specific directory
      And I upload the cookbook
     When I run the chef-client
     Then the run should exit '0'
      And a file named 'host_specific.txt' should be from the 'platform-version' specific directory

  Scenario: Should prefer the file for the correct platform

      And the cookbook has a 'file' named 'host_specific.txt' in the 'platform' specific directory
      And the cookbook has a 'file' named 'host_specific.txt' in the 'default' specific directory
      And I upload the cookbook
     When I run the chef-client
     Then the run should exit '0'
      And a file named 'host_specific.txt' should be from the 'platform' specific directory

  Scenario: Transfer a file from a specific cookbook
    Given a validated node
      And it includes the recipe 'transfer_remote_files::transfer_a_file_from_a_specific_cookbook'
     When I run the chef-client
     Then the run should exit '0'
      And a file named 'from_definition.txt' should contain 'easy like saturday morning'

  Scenario: Change permissions for a pre-existing remote_file
    Given a validated node
      And it includes the recipe 'transfer_remote_files::change_remote_file_perms_trickery'
     When I run the chef-client
