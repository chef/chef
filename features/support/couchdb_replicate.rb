# Under high load with lots of replications going on, CouchDB builtin 
# replication (through the builtin '$DB/_replicate' endpoint) can crash, causing
# further replications to fail by timing out. This then requires a restart of 
# CouchDB.
#
# This code is a manual implementation of CouchDB replication, using standard
# bulk GET's and PUT's. We use RestClient and JSON parsing.

# rows.
